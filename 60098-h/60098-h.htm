  <h2 id='ch01' class='c007'>I.<br /> <br />BUSTER JOHN ALARMS MR. RABBIT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>When Buster John and Sweetest Susan and
Drusilla returned home after their first visit to
Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country, a curious thing
happened. The children had made a bargain
to say nothing about what they had seen and
heard, but one day, when there was nobody else to
hear what she had to say, Sweetest Susan concluded
to tell her mother something about the
visit she had made next door to the world. So
she began and told about the Grandmother of the
Dolls, and about Little Mr. Thimblefinger, and
all about her journey under the spring. Her mother
paid no attention at first, but after awhile she
became interested, and listened intently to everything
her little daughter said. Sometimes she
looked serious, sometimes she smiled, and sometimes
she laughed. Sweetest Susan couldn’t
remember everything, but she told enough to
astonish her mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darling, when did you dream such nonsense
as that?” the lady asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it wasn’t a dream, mamma,” cried Sweetest
Susan. “I thought it was a dream at first,
but it turned out to be no dream at all. Now,
please don’t ask brother about it, and please don’t
ask Drusilla, for we promised one another to say
nothing about it. I didn’t intend to tell you,
but I forgot and began to tell you before I
thought.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A little while afterward Sweetest Susan’s mother
was telling her husband about the wonderful imagination
of their little daughter, and then the
neighbors got hold of it, and some of the old
ladies put their heads together over their teacups
and said it was a sign that Sweetest Susan was
too smart to stay in this world very long.</p>

<p class='c013'>One day, while Drusilla was helping about the
house, Sweetest Susan’s mother took occasion to
ask her where she and the children went the day
they failed to come to dinner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We wuz off gettin’ plums, I speck,” replied
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, there were no plums to get,” said the
lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, ’m, ef  ’t wa’n’t plums, hit must ’a’ been
hick’y nuts,” explained Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hickory nuts were not ripe, stupid.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe dey wa’n’t,” said Drusilla stolidly;
“but dat don’t hinder we chilluns from huntin’
’em.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know you didn’t go after hickory nuts,
Drusilla,” the lady insisted. “Now I want you
to tell me where you and the children went. I’ll
not be angry if you tell me, but if you don’t”—</p>

<p class='c013'>Drusilla could infer a good deal from the tone
of the lady’s voice, but she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, ’m,” she said, “we went down dar by de
spring, an’ down dar by de spring branch, an’ all
roun’ down dar. Ef we warn’t huntin’ plums ner
hick’y nuts, I done fergot what we wuz huntin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Drusilla seemed so much in earnest that the
lady didn’t push the inquiry, but when she went
into another room for a moment, the negro girl
looked after her and remarked to herself:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I done crossed my heart dat I wouldn’t tell,
an’ I ain’t gwine ter. Ef I wuz ter tell, she
wouldn’t b’lieve me, an’ so dar ’t is!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sweetest Susan was careful to say nothing to
Buster John and Drusilla about the slip of the
tongue that caused her to tell her mother about
their adventures in Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer
country; but she didn’t feel very comfortable
when Drusilla told how she had been questioned
by her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ef somebody ain’t done gone an’ tol’ ’er,”
said Drusilla, “she got some mighty quare notions
in ’er head.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John, who had ideas of his own, ignored
all this, and said he was going to put an apple in
the spring the next day and watch for Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, ef you gwine down dar any mo’,” remarked
Drusilla, “you kin des count me out, kaze
I ain’t gwine ’long wid you. I’m one er deze yer
kind er quare folks what know pine blank when
dey done got nuff. I been shaky ever since we
went down in dat ar place what wa’n’t no place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will go,” said Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! Don’t you fool yo’self, honey! You
can’t put no ’pen’ence in a skeer’d nigger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you don’t go, you’ll wish you had,” said
Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?” asked Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait and see,” replied Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning, bright and early, Buster
John put an apple in the spring. He watched it
float around for awhile, and then his attention
was attracted to something else, and he ran away
to see about it. Whatever it was, it interested
him so much that he forgot all about the apple in
the spring, and everything else likely to remind
him of Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John went away from the spring and
left the apple floating there. No sooner had he
gone than one of the house servants chanced to
come along, and the apple was seized and appropriated.
The result was that neither Mr. Thimblefinger
nor Mrs. Meadows saw the signal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John, thinking the apple had remained
in the spring for some hours, waited patiently for
two or three days for Mr. Thimblefinger, but no
Mr. Thimblefinger came. Finally the boy grew
impatient, as youngsters sometimes do. He remembered
that the bottom of the spring, with the
daylight shining through, was the sky of Mr.
Thimblefinger’s queer country, and he concluded
to give Mrs. Meadows and the rest a signal that
they couldn’t fail to see. So, one morning, after
water had been carried to the house for the cook,
and the washerwoman’s tubs had been filled, Buster
John got him some short planks, carrying
them to the spring one by one. These he placed
across the top of the gum, or curb, close together,
so as to shut out the light. Then he perched
himself on a stump not far away, and watched to
see what the effect would be. He knew he had
the sky of Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country
securely roofed in, and he laughed to himself as
he thought of the predicament Mr. Rabbit would
be in, dropping his pipe and hunting for it in
the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John sat there a long time. Mandy,
the washerwoman, got through with her task and
went toward the house, balancing a big basket of
wet clothes on her head and singing as she went.
Sweetest Susan and Drusilla had grown tired
of playing with the dolls, and were hunting all
over the place for Buster John. They saw him
presently, and came running toward him, talking
and laughing. He shook his head and motioned
toward the spring. They became quiet at once,
and began to walk on their tiptoes. They seated
themselves on the stump by Buster John’s side,
and waited for him to explain himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Sweetest Susan saw the boards over
the spring. “Oh, what have you done?” she
cried. “Why, you have shut out the light!
They can’t see a wink. I don’t think that’s right;
do you, Drusilla?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t ax me, honey,” replied Drusilla. “I
ain’t gwine ter git in no ’spute. Somebody done
gone an’ put planks on de spring. Dar dey is,
an’ dar dey may stay, fer what I keer. I hope
dey er nailed down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please take the boards off,” pleaded Sweetest
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Buster John. “I put an apple in
the spring the other day, and they paid no attention
to it. Maybe they’ll pay some attention
now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly, before anybody else could say anything,
Drusilla screamed and rolled off the stump.
Buster John and Sweetest Susan thought a bee
had stung her. But it was not a bee. She had
no sooner rolled from the stump than she sprang
to her feet and cried out, “Dar he is! Look
at ’im!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John and Sweetest Susan turned to
look, and there, upon the stump beside them,
stood Mr. Thimblefinger with his hat in hand,
bowing and smiling as politely as you please.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope you are well,” he said. Then he
began to laugh, as he turned to Buster John.
“You may think it is a great joke to come to the
spring, but it’s no joke to me. I have had a very
hard time getting here, but I just had to come.
Mrs. Meadows thinks there is a total eclipse going
on, and Mr. Rabbit has gone to bed and covered
up his head.”</p>
<div id='i012'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“HOW DID YOU GET HERE?”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“How did you get here?” asked Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Through the big poplar yonder,” said Mr.
Thimblefinger. “It is hollow from top to bottom,
but it was so dark I could hardly find my
way. The jay birds used to go down through
the poplar every Friday until I put up the bars
and shut them out. I had almost forgotten the
road.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Buster John, “I covered the
spring so that you might know we hadn’t forgotten
you. I dropped an apple in the other day,
but you paid no attention to it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw the apple,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger,
“but it didn’t stay in the spring long. It
disappeared in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aha! I know!” exclaimed Drusilla. “Dat
ar Minervy nigger got it. I seed her comin’
long eatin’ a apple, and I boun’ you she de ve’y
nigger what got it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well!” said Mr. Thimblefinger. “It
makes no difference now, and if you’ll get ready
we’ll go now pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I thought you couldn’t go down through
the spring until nine minutes and nine seconds
after twelve,” suggested Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The water gets wet or goes dry with the
tide,” Mr. Thimblefinger explained. “To-day we
shall have to go at nineteen minutes and nineteen
seconds after nine. It was nine minutes and
nine seconds after twelve before, and now it is
nineteen minutes and nineteen seconds after nine.
Multiply nineteen by nineteen, add the answer together,
and you get nothing but nines. You see
we have to go by a system.” Mr. Thimblefinger
was very solemn as he said this. “Now, then,
come on. We haven’t any time to waste. When
the nines get after us, we must be going. There
are four of us now, but if we were to be multiplied
by nine there would be nine of us, and nine
is an odd number.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How would we be nine?” asked Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s very simple,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger.
“Nine times four are thirty-six. Three and six
stand for thirty-six, and six and three are nine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John laughed as he ran to remove the
boards from the spring. In a few moments they
were all ready in spite of Drusilla’s protests, and
at nineteen minutes and nineteen seconds after
nine they walked through the spring gate into
Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>II.<br /> <br /> WHERE THE THUNDER LIVES.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Mrs. Meadows, Mr. Rabbit, Chickamy Crany
Crow, and Tickle-My-Toes were very glad to see
the children, especially Mrs. Meadows, who did
everything she could to make the youngsters feel
that they had conferred a great obligation on her
by coming back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be bound you forgot to bring me the
apple I told you about,” said she.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Sweetest Susan had not forgotten. She
had one in her pocket. It was not very large,
but the sun had painted it red and yellow, and
the south winds that kissed it had left it fragrant
with the perfume of summer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, I declare!” exclaimed Mrs. Meadows.
“To think you should remember an old woman!
You are just as good and as nice as you
can be!” She thanked Sweetest Susan so heartily
that Buster John began to look and feel uncomfortable,—seeing
which, Mrs. Meadows placed
her hand gently on his shoulder. “Never mind,”
said she, “boys are not expected to be as thoughtful
as girls. The next time you come, you may
bring me a hatful, if you can manage to think
about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He might start wid ’em,” remarked Drusilla,
“but ’fo’ he got here he’d set down an’ eat ’em
all up, ter keep from stumpin’ his toe an’ spillin’
’em.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John had a reply ready, but he did not
make any, for just at that moment a low, rumbling
sound was heard. It seemed to come nearer
and grow louder, and then it died away in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is that?” asked Mrs. Meadows, in an
impressive whisper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder,” answered Mr. Rabbit, who had
listened intently. “Thunder, as sure as you’re
born.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mr. Thimblefinger. “I saw a
cloud coming up next door, just before we came
through the spring gate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must be getting nervous in my old age,”
remarked Mrs. Meadows. “I had an idea that it
was too late in the season for thunder-storms.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That may be so,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger,
“but it’s never too late for old man Thunder to
rush out on his front porch and begin to cut up
his capers. But there’s no harm in him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the Lightning kills people sometimes,”
said Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Lightning? Oh, yes, but I was talking
about old man Thunder,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger.
“When I was a boy, I once heard of a
little girl”—Mr. Thimblefinger suddenly put
his hand over his mouth and hung his head, as if
he had been caught doing something wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what in the world is the matter?”
asked Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, nothing,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger.
“I simply forgot my manners.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t see how,” remarked Mr. Rabbit,
frowning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I was about to tell a story before I had
been asked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you won’t disturb me by telling a story,
I’m sure,” said Mr. Rabbit. “I can nod just as
well when some one is talking as when everything
is still. You won’t pester me at all. Just go
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe it isn’t story-telling time,” suggested
Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, don’t say that,” cried Sweetest Susan.
“If it is a story, please tell it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it is nothing but a plain, every-day
story. After you hear it you’ll lean back in your
chair and wonder why somebody didn’t take hold
of it and twist it into a real old-fashioned tale.
It’s old fashioned enough, the way I heard it, but
I always thought that the person who heard it
first must have forgotten parts of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We won’t mind that,” said Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Thimblefinger settled himself comfortably
and began:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once upon a time—I don’t know how long
ago, but not very long, for the tale was new to
me when I first heard it—once upon a time there
was a little girl about your age and size who was
curious to know something about everything that
happened. She wanted to know how a bird could
fly, and why the clouds floated, and she was all
the time trying to get at the bottom of things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, one day when the sky was covered with
clouds, the Thunder came rolling along, knocking
at everybody’s door and running a race with the
noise it made; the little girl listened and wondered
what the Thunder was and where it went to. It
wasn’t long before the Thunder came rumbling
along again, making a noise like a four-horse
wagon running away on a covered bridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“While the little girl was standing there, wondering
and listening, an old man with a bundle on
his back and a stout staff in his hand came along
the road. He bowed and smiled when he saw the
little girl, but as she didn’t return the bow or the
smile, being too much interested in listening for
the Thunder, he paused and asked her what the
trouble was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I hope you are not lost?’ he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, no, sir,’ she replied; ‘I was listening
for the Thunder and wondering where it goes.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, as you seem to be a very good little
girl,’ the old man said, ‘I don’t mind telling you.
The Thunder lives on top of yonder mountain.
It is not so far away.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, I should like ever so much to go there!’
exclaimed the little girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why not?’ said the old man. ‘The mountain
is on my road, and, if you say the word, we’ll
go together.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl took the old man’s hand and
they journeyed toward the mountain where the
Thunder had his home. The way was long, but
somehow they seemed to go very fast. The old
man took long strides forward, and he was strong
enough to lift the little girl at every step, so that
when they reached the foot of the mountain she
was not very tired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, as the mountain was very steep and high,
the two travelers stopped to rest themselves before
they began to climb it. Its sides seemed to be
rough and dark, but far up on the topmost peak
the clouds had gathered, and from these the
Lightning flashed incessantly. The little girl
saw the flashes and asked what they meant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Wherever the Thunder lives,’ replied the old
man, ‘there the Lightning builds its nest. No
doubt the wind has blown the clouds about and
torn them apart and scattered them. The Lightning
is piling them together again, and fixing a
warm, soft place to sleep to-night.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“When they had rested awhile, the old man
said it was time to be going, and then he made
the little girl climb on his back. At first she
didn’t want the old man to carry her; but he
declared that she would do him a great favor by
climbing on his back and holding his bundle in
place. So she sat upon the bundle, and in this
way they went up the high mountain, going
almost as rapidly as the little girl could run on
level ground. She enjoyed it very much, for,
although the old man went swiftly, he went
smoothly, and the little girl felt as safe and as
comfortable as if she had been sitting in a rocking-chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When they had come nearly to the top of the
mountain, the old man stopped and lifted the little
girl from his back. ‘I can go no farther,’ he
said. ‘The rest of the way you will have to go
alone. There is nothing to fear. Up the mountain
yonder you can see the gable of the Thunder’s
house. Go to the door, knock, and do not
be alarmed at any noise you hear. When the
time comes for you to go, you will find me awaiting
you here.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl hesitated, but she had come so
far to see where the Thunder lived that she would
not turn back now. So she went forward, and
soon came to the door of Mr. Thunder’s house.
It was a very big door to a very big house. The
knocker was so heavy that the little girl could
hardly lift it, and when she let it fall against the
panel, the noise it made jarred the building and
sent a loud echo rolling and tumbling down the
mountain. The little girl thought, ‘What have I
done? If the Thunder is taking a nap before
dinner, he’ll be very angry.’</p>
<div id='i022'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>SHE WAITED A LITTLE WHILE</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“She waited a little while, not feeling very
comfortable. Presently she heard heavy footsteps
coming down the wide hall to the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I thought I heard some one knocking,’ said
a hoarse, gruff voice. Then the big door flew
open, and there, standing before her, the little girl
saw a huge figure that towered almost to the top
of the high door. It wore heavy boots, a big
overcoat, and under its long, thick beard there
was a muffler a yard wide. The little girl was
very much frightened at first, but she soon remembered
that there was nothing for such a little
bit of a girl to be afraid of.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The figure, that seemed to be so terrible at
first glance, had nothing threatening about it.
‘Who knocked at the door?’ it cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Its voice sounded so loud that the little girl
put her fingers in her ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t talk so loud, please,’ she said. ‘I’m
not deaf.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh!’ cried the giant at the door. ‘You are
there, are you? You are so small I didn’t see
you at first. Come in!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl started to go in, and then
paused. ‘Are you the Thunder?’ she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, of course,’ was the reply; ‘who else
did you think it was?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I didn’t know,’ said the little girl. ‘I
wanted to be certain about it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Come in,’ said the Thunder. ‘It isn’t often
I have company from the people below, and I’m
glad you found me at home.’</p>

<p class='c013'>The Thunder led the way down the hall and
into a wide sitting-room, where a fire was burning
brightly in the biggest fireplace the little girl had
ever seen. A two-horse wagon could turn around
in it without touching the andirons. A pair of
tongs as tall as a man stood in one corner, and in
the other corner was a shovel to match. A long
pipe lay on the mantel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There’s no place for you to sit except on the
floor,’ said the Thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I can sit on the bed,’ suggested the little
girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Thunder laughed so loudly that the little
girl had to close her ears again. ‘Why, that is
no bed,’ the Thunder said when it could catch its
breath; ‘that’s my footstool.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ said the little girl, ‘it’s big enough
for a bed. It’s very soft and nice.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I find it very comfortable,’ said the Thunder,
‘especially when I get home after piloting a
tornado through the country. It is tough work,
as sure as you are born.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Thunder took the long pipe from the
mantel and lit it with a pine splinter, the flame of
which flashed through the windows with dazzling
brightness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Folks will say that is heat lightning,’ remarked
the little girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes,’ replied the Thunder; ‘farmers to the
north of us will say there is going to be a drought,
because of lightning in the south. Farmers to
the south of us will say there’s going to be rain,
because of lightning in the north. None of them
knows that I am smoking my pipe.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But somehow, in turning around, the Thunder
knocked the big tongs over, and they fell upon
the floor with a tremendous crash. The floor
appeared to give forth a sound like a drum, only
a thousand times louder, and, although the little
girl had her fingers in her ears, she could hear
the echoes roused under the house by the falling
tongs go rattling down the mountain side and out
into the valley beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Thunder sat in the big armchair smoking,
and listening with legs crossed. The little
girl appeared to be sorry that she had come.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now, that is too bad,’ said the Thunder.
‘The Whirlwind in the south will hear that and
come flying; the West Wind will hear it and
come rushing, and they will drag the clouds after
them, thinking that I am ready to take my ride.
But it’s all my fault. Instead of turning the
winds in the pasture, I ought to have put them in
the stable. Here they come now!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl listened, and, sure enough, the
whirlwinds from the south and the west came
rushing around the house of the Thunder. The
west wind screamed around the windows, and the
whirlwinds from the south whistled through the
cracks and keyholes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I guess I’ll have to go with them,’ said the
Thunder, rising from the chair and walking
around the room. ‘It’s the only way to quiet
them.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Do you always wear your overcoat?’ the little
girl asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Always,’ replied the Thunder. ‘There’s no
telling what moment I’ll be called. Sometimes I
go just for a frolic, and sometimes I am obliged
to go. Will you stay until I return?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, no,’ the little girl replied; ‘the house is
too large. I should be afraid to stay here alone.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I am sorry,’ said the Thunder. ‘Come and
see me get in my carriage.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“They went to the door. The whirlwinds
from the south and the winds from the west had
drawn the clouds to the steps, and into these the
Thunder climbed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Good-by,’ he cried to the little girl. ‘Stay
where you are until we are out of sight.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was a flash of light, a snapping sound,
a rattling crash, and the Thunder, with the clouds
for his carriage and the winds for his horses, went
roaming and rumbling through the sky, over the
hills and valleys.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Thimblefinger paused and looked at the
children. They, expecting him to go on, said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How did you like my story?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it a story?” inquired Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, call it a tale,” said Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hit’s too high up in de elements for ter suit
me,” said Drusilla, candidly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What became of the little girl?” asked
Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the Thunder rolled away,” said Mr.
Thimblefinger, “she went back to where the old
man was awaiting her, and he, having nothing to
do, carried her to the Jumping-Off Place.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>III.<br /> <br />THE JUMPING-OFF PLACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The children looked at Mr. Thimblefinger to
see whether he was joking about the Jumping-Off
Place, but he seemed to be very serious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have heard of the Jumping-Off Place,” remarked
Mrs. Meadows, “but I had an idea it was
just a saying.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger, “where
you see a good deal of smoke, there must be some
fire. When you hear a great many different people
talking about anything, there must be something
in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did the little girl see when she got
to the Jumping-Off Place?” inquired Sweetest
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was this way,” said Mr. Thimblefinger:
“When the whirlwinds from the south and the
winds from the west, working in double harness,
carried the thick clouds away, and the Thunder
with them, the little girl went back to the place
where she had left the old man who had carried
her up the mountain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She found him waiting. He was sitting at
the foot of a tree, sleeping peacefully, but he
awoke at once.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You see I am waiting for you,’ he said.
‘How did you enjoy your visit?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I didn’t enjoy it much,’ replied the little
girl. ‘Everything was so large, and the Thunder
made so much fuss.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I hope you didn’t mind that,’ said the old
man. ‘The Thunder is a great growler and
grumbler, but when that’s said, all’s said. I
am sorry, though, you didn’t have a good time.
I suppose you think it is my fault, but it isn’t.
If you say so, I’ll go to the Jumping-Off Place.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where is that?’ asked the little girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Just beyond the Well at the End of the
World.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘If it isn’t too far, let’s go there,’ said the
little girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the old man lifted her on his back, and
they went on their way. They must have gone
very swiftly, for it wasn’t long before they came
to the Well at the End of the World. An old
woman was sitting near the Well, combing her
hair. She paid no attention to the travelers, nor
they to her. When they had gone beyond the
Well a little distance, the little girl noticed that
the sky appeared to be very close at hand. It
was no longer blue, but dark, and seemed to
hang down like a blanket or a curtain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But that couldn’t be, you know,” said Buster
John, “for the sky is no sky at all. It is
nothing but space.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How comes it dey call it sky, ef ’t ain’t no
sky?” asked Drusilla, indignantly. “An’ how
come’t ain’t no sky, when it’s right up dar, plain
ez de han’ fo’ yo’ face? Dat what I’d like ter
know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, the moon is thousands of miles away,”
said Buster John, “and some of the stars are
millions and millions of miles farther than the
moon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dat what dey say,” replied Drusilla, “but
how dey know? Whar de string what dey
medjud ’em wid? Tell me dat!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What about our sky?” asked Mrs. Meadows,
smiling. “You would never think it was only
the bottom of the spring if you didn’t know it;
now would you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John had nothing to say in reply to
this. Whereupon Sweetest Susan begged Mr.
Thimblefinger to please go on with his story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said he, “if I am to go on with it,
I’ll have to tell it just as I heard it. I’ll have
to put the sky just where I was told it was.
When the little girl and the old man came close
to the Jumping-Off Place, they saw that the sky
was hanging close at hand. It may have been
far, it may have been near, but to the little girl
it seemed to be close enough to touch, and she
wished very much for a long pole, so that she
could see whether it was made of muslin or ginghams.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO A PRECIPICE</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Presently they came to a precipice. There
was nothing beyond it and nothing below it.
‘This,’ said the old man to the little girl, ‘is the
Jumping-Off Place.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Does any one jump off here?’ said the little
girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not that I know of,’ replied the old man,
‘but if they should take a notion to, the place is
all ready for them.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where would I fall to, if I jumped off?’ the
little girl asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘To Nowhere,’ answered the old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is very funny,’ said the little girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes,’ remarked the old man, ‘you can get
to the End of the World, but you would have to
travel many a long year before you get to Nowhere.
Some say it is a big city, some say it
is a high mountain, and some say it is a wide
plain.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl went to the Jumping-Off Place
and looked over, the old man holding her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, I see the moon shining down there,’
she said. She was glad to see so familiar a face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old man laughed. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘the
moon is very fond of shining down there, and it
runs away from the sun every chance it gets, and
hunts up the darkest places, so that it may shine
there undisturbed. To-day it is shining down
there where the sun can’t see it, but to-night it
will creep up here, when the sun goes away, and
shine the whole night through.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Turning back, the old man and the little girl
came again to the Well at the End of the World.
The old woman was sitting there, combing her
long white hair. This time she looked hard at
the little girl and smiled, singing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘When the heart is young the well is dry—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oh, it’s good-by, dearie! good-by!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“But the old man shook his head. ‘We have
not come here for nothing, Sister Jane,’ he said.
With that he took a small vial, tied a long string
to it, and let it down the well. He fished about
until the vial was full of water, drew it to the top,
and corked it tightly. The water sparkled in the
sun as if it were full of small diamonds. Then
he placed it carefully in his pocket, bowed politely
to the old woman, who was still combing
her long, white hair, and, smiling, lifted the little
girl to his back, and returned along the road they
had come, past the Thunder’s house and down
the mountain side, until they reached the little
girl’s home. Then he took the vial of sparkling
water from his pocket. ‘Take it,’ he said, ‘and
wherever you go keep it with you. Touch a drop
of it to your forehead when Friday is the thirteenth
day of a month, and you will grow up to
be both wise and beautiful. When you are in
trouble, turn the vial upside down—so—and
hold it in that position while you count twenty-six,
and some of your friends will come to your
aid.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl thanked the old man as politely
as she knew how.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Do you know why I have carried you to the
Thunder’s house and to the Jumping-Off Place,
and why I have given you a vial of this rare
water?’ The little girl shook her head. ‘Well,
one day, not long ago, you were sitting by the
roadside with some of your companions. You
were all eating cake. A beggar came along and
asked for a piece. You alone gave him any, and
you gave him all you had.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Were you the beggar?’ asked the little girl,
smiling and blushing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That I leave you to guess,’ replied the old
man. He kissed the little girl’s hand, and was
soon hid from sight by a turn in the road.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Thimblefinger stopped short here, and
waited to see what the children would say. They
had listened attentively, but they manifested no
very great interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon they think there is more talk than
tale in what you have told,” remarked Mr. Rabbit,
leaning back in his chair. “That’s the way
it appeared to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll not say that I have come to the
end of my story,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger,
with some show of dignity, “but I have come to
the part where we can rest awhile, so as to give
Mr. Rabbit a chance to see if he can do any better.
We’ll allow the little girl to grow some,
just as she does in the story.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>IV.<br /> <br />THE BLUE HEN’S CHICKEN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not much of a story-teller,” said Mr.
Rabbit, “and I never set up for one, but I will
say that I like the rough-and-tumble tales a great
deal better than I do the kind where some great
somebody is always coming in with conjurings
and other carryings-on. It’s on account of my
raising, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, stories can’t be all alike,” remarked
Mrs. Meadows. “You might as well expect a
fiddle to play one tune.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell us the kind of story you like best,” said
Buster John to Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, not now,” responded Mr. Rabbit. “I’ll
do that some other time. I happened to think
just now of a little circumstance that I used to
hear mentioned when I was younger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the country next door there used to be a
great many chickens. Some were of the barnyard
breed, some were of the kind they call game,
some were black, some were white, some were
brown, some were speckled, and some had their
feathers curled the wrong way. Among all these
there was one whose name, as well as I can remember,
was Mrs. Blue Hen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was she really blue?” Sweetest Susan inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, not an indigo blue,” replied Mr. Rabbit,
after reflecting a moment, “nor yet a sky
blue. She was just a plain, dull, every-day blue.
But, such as she was, she was very fine. She belonged
to one of the first families and moved in
the very best circles. She was trim-looking, so
I’ve heard said, and, as she grew older, came to
have a very bad temper, so much so that she used
to fly at a hawk if he came near her premises.
Some of her neighbors used to whisper it around
that she tried to crow like a rooster, but this was
after she had grown old and hard-headed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When Mrs. Blue Hen was growing up, she
was very nice and particular. She couldn’t bear
to get water on her feet, and she was always
shaking the dust from her clothes. Some said
she was finicky, and some said she was nervous.
Once, when she fanned out little Billy Bantam,
who called on her one day, a great many of her
acquaintances said she would never settle down
and make a good housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But after awhile Mrs. Blue Hen concluded
that it was about time for her to have a family of
her own, so she went away off from the other
chickens and made her a nest in the middle of a
thick briar patch. She made her a nest there and
laid an egg. It was new and white, and Mrs.
Blue Hen was very proud of it. She was so
proud, in fact, that, although she had made up
her mind to make no fuss over it, she went running
and cackling toward the house, just as any
common hen would do. She made so much fuss
that away down in the branch Mr. Willy Weasel
winked at Miss Mimy Mink.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Do you hear that?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I never heard anything plainer in my life,’
says she.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Blue Hen was so proud of her new,
white egg that she went back after awhile to look
at it. There it was, shining white in the grass.
She covered it up and hid it as well as she could,
and then she went about getting dinner ready.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The next morning she went to the nest and
laid another egg just like the first one. This
happened for three mornings; but on the fourth
morning, when Mrs. Blue Hen went back, she
found four eggs in the nest, and all four appeared
to be dingy and muddy looking. She was very
much astonished and alarmed, as well she might
be, for here right before her eyes she saw four
eggs, when she knew in reason that there should
be but three; and not only that, they were all
dingy and dirty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Blue Hen was so excited that she took
off her bonnet and began to fan herself. Then
she wondered whether she had not made a miscount;
whether she had not really laid four instead
of three eggs. The more she thought about
it, the more confused she became. She hung her
bonnet on a blackberry bush and tried to count
off the days on her toes. She began to count,—’One,
two, three,’—and she would have stopped
there, but she couldn’t. She had four toes on
her foot, and she was compelled to count them
all. There was a toe on the foot for every egg
in the nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This caused Mrs. Blue Hen to feel somewhat
more comfortable in mind and body, but she was
left in such a hysterical state that she went off
cackling nervously, and postponed laying an egg
until late in the afternoon. After that there were
five in the nest, and she kept on laying until there
were ten altogether. Then Mrs. Blue Hen rumpled
up her feathers and got mad with herself, and
went to setting. I reckon that’s what you call
it. I’ve heard some call it ‘setting’ and others
‘sitting.’ Once, when I was courting, I spoke of
a sitting hen, but the young lady said I was too
prissy for anything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is prissy?” asked Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit shut his eyes and scratched his ear.
Then he shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s nothing but a girl’s word,” remarked
Mrs. Meadows by way of explanation. “It means
that somebody’s trying hard to show off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s so,” said Mr. Rabbit, opening
his eyes. He appeared to be much relieved.
“Well, Mrs. Blue Hen got mad and went to setting.
She was in a snug place and nobody bothered
her. It was such a quiet place that she could
hear Mr. Willy Weasel and Miss Mimy Mink gossiping
in the calamus bushes, and she could hear
Mrs. Puddle Duck wading in the branch. One
day Mrs. Puddle Duck made so bold as to push
her way through the briars and look in upon
Mrs. Blue Hen. But her visit was not relished.
Mrs. Blue Hen rumpled her feathers up and
spread out her tail to such a degree and squalled
out such a harsh protest that Mrs. Puddle Duck
was glad to waddle off with whole bones. But
when she got back to the branch she spluttered
about a good deal, crying out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Aha! aha! quack, quack! Aha! You are
there, are you? Aha! you’ll have trouble before
you get away. Aha!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now the fact was that Mrs. Puddle Duck was
the very one that had caused Mrs. Blue Hen all
the trouble,” said Mr. Rabbit, nodding his head
solemnly. “While wading in the branch, Mrs.
Puddle Duck had seen Mrs. Blue Hen going to
her nest for three days, slipping and creeping
through the weeds and bushes, and she wanted
to know what all the slipping and creeping was
about. So, on the third day Mrs. Puddle Duck
did some slipping and creeping on her own account.
She crept up close enough to see Mrs.
Blue Hen on her nest, and she was near enough to
see Mrs. Blue Hen when she ran away cackling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then Mrs. Puddle Duck waddled up and
peeped in the nest. There she saw three eggs as
white and as smooth as ivory, and the sight filled
her with jealousy. She began to talk to herself:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I knew she must be mighty proud, the stuck-up
thing! I can see that by the way she steps
around here. Quack, quack! and I’ll just show
her a thing or two.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then and there Mrs. Puddle Duck, all muddy
as she was, got in Mrs. Blue Hen’s nest and sat
on her beautiful white eggs and soiled them.
And even that was not all. Out of pure spite
Mrs. Puddle Duck laid one of her own dingy-looking
eggs in Mrs. Blue Hen’s nest, and that
was the cause of all the trouble. That was the
reason Mrs. Blue Hen found four dingy eggs in
her nest when there ought to have been three
clean white ones.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Mrs. Blue Hen went to setting, and
after so long a time nine little chickens were
hatched. She was very proud of them. She
taught them how to talk, and then she wanted to
get off her nest and teach them how to scratch
about and earn their own living. But there was
still one egg to hatch, and so Mrs. Blue Hen continued
to set on it. One day she made up her
mind to take her chicks off and leave the egg that
wouldn’t hatch. The old Speckled Hen happened
to be passing and Mrs. Blue Hen asked
her advice. But the old Speckled Hen was very
much shocked when she heard the particulars.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What! with nine chickens!’ she cried.
‘Why, nine is an odd number. It would never
do in the world. Hatch out the other egg.’</p>
<div id='i042'  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>ONE OF THEM WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE REST</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“But young people are very impatient, and
Mrs. Blue Hen was young. She fretted and worried
a good deal, but in a few days the tenth egg
hatched. Mrs. Blue Hen felt very much better
after this. In fact, she felt so comfortable that
she didn’t take the trouble to look at the chicken
that hatched from the tenth egg. But when she
brought her children off the nest she was very
much astonished to find that one of them was entirely
different from all the rest. She was not
only surprised, but shocked. Nine of her children
were as neat-looking as she could wish them
to be, but the tenth one was a sight to see. It
had weak eyes, a bill as broad as a case-knife, and
big, flat feet. Its feet were so big that it waddled
when it walked, and all the toes of each foot
were joined together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Blue Hen had very high notions. She
wanted everybody to think that she belonged to
the quality, but this wabbly chicken with a broad
bill and a foot that had no instep to it took her
pride down a peg. She kept her children hid as
long as she could, but she had to come out in
public after a while, and when she did—well,
I’ll let you know there was an uproar in the
barnyard. The old Speckled Hen was the first
to begin it. She cried out:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Look—look—look! Look at the Blue
Hen’s chickens!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the Guinea hens began to laugh, and the
old Turkey Gobbler was so tickled he came near
swallowing his snout. Mrs. Blue Hen hung her
head with shame, and carried her children away
off in the woods.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But her flat-footed chicken gave rise to a byword
in all that country. When any stranger
came along looking rough and ragged, it was
the common saying that he was the Blue Hen’s
chicken.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve heard it many a time,” remarked Mrs.
Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was no story in that,” Buster John
suggested.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” replied Mr. Rabbit. “Just some every-day
facts picked up and strung together.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speaking of stories,” said Mrs. Meadows, “I
have one in my mind that is a sure enough story—one
of the old-fashioned kind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, please, ma’am, tell it,” said Buster
John, so seriously that they all laughed except
Mr. Rabbit.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>“What about the little girl who had the vial of
sparkling water?” said Sweetest Susan, turning
to Mr. Thimblefinger, just as Mrs. Meadows was
about to begin her story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, she is growing,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John frowned at his sister, as boys will
do when they are impatient, and Sweetest Susan
said no more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once upon a time,” Mrs. Meadows began,
rubbing her chin thoughtfully, “there was a
country that suddenly found itself without a king.
This was a long time ago, before people in some
parts of the world began to think it was unfashionable
to have kings. I don’t know what
the trouble was exactly, whether the king died,
or whether he was carried off, or whether he did
something to cause the people to take away his
crown and put him in the calaboose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyhow, they suddenly found themselves
without a king, and it made them feel very uncomfortable.
They were so restless and uneasy that
they couldn’t sleep well at night. They were in
the habit of having a king to govern them, and
they felt very nervous without one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now in that country there were eleven wise
men whose trade it was to give advice. Instead
of falling out and wrangling with one another
and ruining their business, these eleven wise men
had formed a copartnership and set up a sort
of store, where anybody and everybody could get
advice by the wholesale or retail. I don’t know
whether they charged anything, because there
never has been a time since the world had more
than two people in it that advice wasn’t as cheap
as dirt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The eleven wise men were there, ready to
give advice, and so the people went to them and
asked them how to select a king. The eleven
wise men put their heads together, and after
a while they told the people that they must select
nine of their best men and send them out on the
roads leading to the capital city, and when these
nine men found a man sleeping in the shade of a
tree, they were to watch him for four hours, and
if the shadow of the tree stood still so as to keep
the sun from shining on him, he was the one to
select for their king. Then the eleven wise men,
looking very solemn, bowed the people out, and
the people went off and selected nine of their
best men to find them a king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now it happened that in a part of the country
not far from the capital city there lived a boy
with his mother and stepfather. They were not
poor and they were not rich, but everybody said
the boy was the handsomest and brightest that
had ever been seen in that section. He was about
sixteen years old, and was very strong and tall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One day, when the stepfather was in the village
near which they lived, a stranger passed
through on his way to the capital city. He had
neither wallet nor staff, but he drew a great crowd
of idle people around him. He was carrying a
red rooster, and although the fowl’s feet were tied
together and his head hanging down, he crowed
lustily every few minutes. It was this that drew
the crowd of idle people. One with more curiosity
than the rest asked the stranger why the
rooster crowed and continued to crow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘He is a royal bird,’ the stranger replied.
‘There is no king in this country, and whoever
eats this bird’s head will reign as king.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘He must be worth a pretty sum,’ said one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘By no means,’ answered the stranger. ‘He
is worth no more than a silver piece.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the people only laughed. They thought
the stranger was making fun of them. He went
on his way, and had soon passed beyond the village.
Now it chanced that the stepfather of the
bright and handsome boy was in the crowd that
gathered around the stranger. He thought it
was very queer that a rooster should be crowing
so bravely when his legs were tied together and
while his head was hanging down. So he said to
himself that there might be some truth in what
the stranger said. He ran after the man and soon
overtook him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is a fine fowl,’ said the boy’s stepfather.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It is a royal bird,’ the stranger replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What is he worth?’ asked the boy’s stepfather.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I shall be glad to get rid of him,’ said the
stranger. ‘Give me a piece of silver and take
him.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“This was soon done, and the stepfather took
the rooster under his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Remember this,’ remarked the stranger; ‘if
you eat the head of that bird you will reign in
this country as king.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, ho!’ laughed the boy’s stepfather, ‘you
are a fine joker.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With the fowl under his arm he went toward
his home. He had gone but a little way when he
turned to look at the stranger, but the man had
disappeared. The country was level for a long
distance in all directions, but the stranger could
not be seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boy’s stepfather carried the fowl home
and said to his wife:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Cook this bird for supper. Cook the head
also.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man was afraid to tell his wife why he
wanted the head cooked. He knew she was very
fond of her son, and he reasoned to himself that
if she knew what the stranger had said she would
give the head to the boy. So he only told her to
be careful to cook the fowl’s head and save it for
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The wife did as she was bid. She cooked the
fowl and the fowl’s head, and placed them away
in the cupboard until her husband and her son
came home. It happened that something kept
the husband in the village a little later than usual,
and while the woman was waiting for him her son
came in and said he was very hungry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You will find something in the cupboard,’
his mother said. ‘Eat a little now, and when
your stepfather returns we will have supper.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boy went to the cupboard. The fowl
was on a big dish ready to be carved, and the
head was in the saucer by itself. To save time
and trouble the boy took the head and ate it, and
then felt as if he could wait for supper very comfortably.
The husband came, and the woman
proceeded to set the table. When she came to
look for the fowl’s head it was gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, I ate it,’ said her son, when he heard
her exclamation of surprise. ‘I found it in the
saucer, and I ate it rather than cut the fowl.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The stepfather was angry enough to tear his
hair, but he said nothing. The next day the boy
went hunting. He was ready to return about
noon, but, being tired, he stretched himself in the
shade of a tree and was soon sound asleep.</p>
<div id='i052'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i052.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THEY SAW THE HANDSOME BOY SLEEPING</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“While he was sleeping his soundest, the nine
men who had been appointed by the people to
find them a king chanced to pass that way. They
saw the handsome boy sleeping in the shade of
the tree, and they stationed themselves around and
watched him. For four long hours they watched
the boy, but still the shadow of the tree kept
the sun from his face. The nine men consulted
among themselves, and they came to the conclusion
that the shadow of the tree hadn’t moved,
and that the boy was a well-favored lad who
would look very well when he was dressed up and
put on a throne with a crown on his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they shook the boy and aroused him from
his sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What’s your name?’ asked the spokesman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Telambus,’ replied the boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where do you live?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not far from here.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How would you like to be king?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I have never tried it. Is it an easy trade to
learn?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The nine men looked at each other shrewdly
and smiled. They each had the same thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They went with the boy to his home and saw
his mother, and inquired about his age and his
education, and asked a hundred other questions
besides. They cautioned the woman as they were
leaving to say nothing of their visit except this,
that they were going about hunting for a king
and had called to make some inquiries.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When her husband came home he had already
heard of the visit of the distinguished company,
and so he asked his wife a thousand questions.
All the answer he got was that the visitors were
hunting for a king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m sure it was for me they were hunting,’
said the man. ‘How unfortunate that I was
away.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, don’t worry,’ replied his wife. ‘If
they ever intended to make you king, they’ll come
back after you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You don’t seem to think much about it,’
remarked the man, ‘but some of these days
you’ll find out that you narrowly escaped being
the king’s wife.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The nine citizens were so certain that they
had found the right person to rule over their
country as king, that they made haste to return
to the capital city and tell the news to the eleven
wise men who had sent them out. They made
their report, and the eleven wise men put their
heads together once more. When they had consulted
together a long time, they said to the people:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There is one test by which you may know
whether a king has been found. Send a messenger
and ask this young man to send us a rope
made of sand a hundred feet long.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The messenger straightway went to the
house of Telambus and told him what the eleven
wise men had said. His mother straightway fell
to crying. But Telambus laughed at her fears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Tell the eleven wise men,’ he said to the
messenger, ‘that there are various patterns of
sand ropes. Let them send me a sample of the
kind they want—a piece only a foot long—and
I will make them one a hundred feet long.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The messenger returned to the eleven wise
men and told them what Telambus had said.
They put their heads together again and then told
the people that the young man was wise enough
to be their king. There was great rejoicing then,
and the nine wise men who had found him went
to fetch him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Telambus shook his head. ‘Kings are
not carried about in this way. Where are your
banners and your chariots? Where are your
drums and your cymbals?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the nine men returned to the eleven wise
men and told them what Telambus had said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘He is right,’ said the eleven wise men. ‘He
is a king already. Get your horses, your chariots,
your banners, and your music, and bring our
king in as he deserves to be brought.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So Telambus was made the king of that
country.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this point Mrs. Meadows began to hunt for
a knitting-needle she had dropped, and the children
knew that the story was ended.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was a pretty good story,” said Mr.
Thimblefinger. “It was short and sweet, as the
king-bird said to the honey-bee.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dey wuz too much kingin’ in it ter suit me.
Ef folks got ter have kings, how come we ain’t
got none?” asked Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please tell me about the little girl with the
vial of sparkling water from the Well at the End
of the World,” said Sweetest Susan to Mr. Thimblefinger.
“I expect she is nearly grown by this
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger, “she
has now grown to be quite a young lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” grunted Drusilla, “ef folks grow up
dat quick, I dunner what hinder me from bein’
a ol’ gray-head ’oman by sundown.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>VI.<br /> <br />THE MAGIC RING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Don’t you see,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, with
apparent seriousness, “that if we hadn’t left off
the story of the little girl who went to the Well
at the End of the World just where we did, she
would have had no time to grow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John smiled faintly, but Sweetest Susan
took the statement seriously, though she said
nothing. Drusilla boldly indorsed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I speck dat’s so,” she said, “kaze when de
lil’ gal got back home wid dat vial she wa’n’t in
no fix fer ter cut up dem kind er capers what de
tales tell about.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly not,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger,
“but now she has had time to grow up to be a
young lady, almost. Names go for so little down
here that I haven’t told you hers. She was
named Eolen. Some said it was a beautiful name,
but her stepmother and her stepmother’s daughter
said it was very ugly. Anyhow, that was her
name, and whether it was ugly or whether it was
beautiful, she had to make the best of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Eolen went home when the old man
gave her the vial of water from the Well at the
End of the World. She hid the vial beneath her
apron until she reached her own room, and then
she placed it at the very bottom of her little trunk,—a
trunk that had belonged to her mother, who
was dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing happened for a long time. Whenever
Friday fell on the thirteenth of a month,
Eolen would rub a drop of the sparkling water
on her forehead, and she grew to be the loveliest
young lady that ever was seen. Her stepsister
was not bad-looking, but, compared with Eolen,
she was ugly. The contrast between them was so
great that people could not help noticing it and
making remarks about it. Some of these remarks
came to the ears of her stepmother.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now a stepmother can be just as nice and as
good as anybody, but this particular stepmother
cared for nothing except her own child, and she
soon came to hate Eolen for being so beautiful.
She had never treated the child kindly, but now
she began to treat her cruelly. Eolen never told
her father, but somehow he seemed to know what
was going on, and he treated her more affectionately
each day, as her stepmother grew more
cruel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This lasted for some time, but finally Eolen’s
father fell ill and died, and then, although she
had many admirers, she was left without a friend
she could confide in or rely on. To make matters
worse, her stepmother produced a will in
which her husband had left everything to her
and nothing to Eolen. The poor girl didn’t
know what to do. She knew that her father had
made no such will, but how could she prove it?
She happened to think of the vial of sparkling
waters. She found it and turned it upside down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the instant there was a loud knock at the
street door. Eolen would have gone to open it,
but her stepmother was there before her. She
peeped from behind the curtains in the hallway,
and saw a tall, richly-dressed stranger standing
on the steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I wish to see a young lady who lives here.
She is the daughter of an old friend,’ said the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The stepmother smiled very sweetly. ‘Come
in. I will call her.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But instead of calling Eolen she called her
own daughter. The girl went, but not with a
good grace. She had been petted and spoiled,
and was very saucy and impolite. The stranger
smiled when he saw her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What was my mother doing when you saw
her sitting by the Well at the End of the World?’
he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Do you take me for a crazy person?’ replied
the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘By no means,’ said the stranger. ‘You are
not the young lady I came to see.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The stepmother then called Eolen and stood
in the room frowning to see what was going to
happen. Eolen came as soon as she was called,
and the stranger seemed to be much struck by her
beauty and modesty. He took her by the hand
and led her to a chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What was my mother doing when you saw
her sitting by the Well at the End of the World?’
he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘She was combing her hair,’ replied Eolen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is true,’ remarked the stranger. ‘Yes,
she was combing her hair.’ Then he turned to
the stepmother and said: ‘May I see this young
lady alone for a little while? I have a message
for her from an old friend.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Certainly!’ the stepmother answered. ‘I
hope her friend is well-to-do, for her father has
died without leaving her so much as a farthing.’
Having said this, the stepmother flounced from
the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I came at your summons,’ said the stranger;
‘you turned the vial of sparkling water upside
down, and now I am here to do your bidding.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then Eolen told him of the death of her
father, and how he had left all of his property
to her stepmother. The stranger listened attentively,
and while he listened played with a heavy
gold ring that he wore on his third finger. When
Eolen was through with her story he took this
ring from his finger and handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Look through that,’ he said, ‘and tell me
what you see.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eolen held the ring to one of her eyes, and
peeped through the golden circle. She was so
surprised that she came near dropping the ring.
She had held it up toward the stranger, but instead
of seeing him through the ring she seemed
to be looking into a room in which some person
was moving about. As she continued to look, the
scene appeared to be a familiar one. The room
was the one her stepmother occupied—the room
in which her father had died. She saw her stepmother
take from her father’s private drawer a
folded paper and hide it behind the mantel. Then
the scene vanished, and through the ring she saw
the stranger smiling at her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What you have seen happened some time
ago.’ He took the ring and replaced it on his
finger. ‘Your stepmother is now coming this
way. She has been trying to hear what we are
saying. When she comes in, do you get your
father’s real will from behind the mantel and
bring it to me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure enough the stepmother came into the
room silently and suddenly. She pretended to be
much surprised to find any one there.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You must excuse me,’ she said to the stranger.
‘I imagined I heard you take your leave
some time ago.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You are excusable,’ replied the stranger.
‘I have been reflecting rather than talking. I
have been thinking what could be done for your
stepdaughter, who must be quite a burden to
you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The stepmother took this for an invitation to
tell what she knew about Eolen, and you may be
sure she didn’t waste any praise on the young
lady. But right in the midst of it all Eolen, who
had gone out, returned and handed the stranger
the folded paper that had been hid behind the
mantel. The stepmother recognized it and turned
pale.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘This,’ said the stranger, opening the paper
and reading it at a glance, ‘is your father’s will.
I see he has left you half the property.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is the will my husband forgot to destroy,’
cried the stepmother. ‘I have the real
will.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘May I see it?’ asked the stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The stepmother ran to fetch it, but when the
stranger had opened it, not a line nor a word of
writing could be found on it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I see you are fond of a joke,’ said the
stranger, but the stepmother had fallen into a
chair and sat with her face hid in her hands. ‘I
am fond of a joke myself,’ continued the stranger,
‘and I think I can match yours.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With that the stranger took the real will,
tore it in small pieces and threw it into the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What have you done?’ cried Eolen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The most difficult thing in the world,’ replied
the stranger; ‘I have made this lady happy.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And sure enough the stepmother was smiling
and thanking him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I thought you were my enemy,’ she said,
‘but now I see you are my friend indeed. How
can I repay you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘By treating this young lady here as your
daughter,’ he replied. ‘Have no fear,’ he said,
turning to Eolen. ‘No harm can befall you.
What I have done is for the best.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But before he went away he gave Eolen the
gold ring, and told her to wear it for the sake of
his mother, who sat by the Well at the End of
the World. She thanked him for his kindness
and promised she would keep the ring and treasure
it as long as she lived.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But there was one trouble with this magic
ring. It was too large for any of Eolen’s fingers.
She had the whitest and most beautiful hands
ever seen, but the ring would fit none of her
fingers. Around her neck she wore a necklace
of coral beads, and on this necklace she hung the
ring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For many day’s Eolen’s stepmother was kind
to her, almost too kind. But the woman was
afraid her stepdaughter would inform the judges
of her effort to steal and hide her husband’s will.
The judges were very severe in those days and in
that country, and if the woman had been brought
before them and such a crime proven on her, she
would have been sent to the rack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is a rack?” asked Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hit’s de place whar dey scrunch folks’s ve’y
vitals out’n ’em,” said Drusilla solemnly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s about right, I reckon,” assented Mr.
Thimblefinger. “Well, the stepmother was as
kind to Eolen as she knew how to be, but the
kindness didn’t last long. She hated her stepdaughter
worse than ever. She was afraid of
her, but she didn’t hate her any the less on that
account.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eolen had a habit of taking off her coral
necklace and placing it under her pillow at night.
One night, when she was fast asleep, her stepmother
crept into the room and slipped the ring
from the necklace. She had no idea it was a
magic ring. She said to herself that it would
look better on her daughter’s finger than it did
on Eolen’s coral necklace, so she took the ring
and slipped it on the finger of her sleeping daughter,
and then stepped back a little to admire the
big golden circle on the coarse, red hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Almost immediately the daughter began to
toss and tumble in her sleep. She flung her arms
wildly about and tried to talk. The mother, becoming
alarmed, tried to wake her, but it was some
time before the girl could be roused from her
troubled sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh!’ she cried, when she awoke, ‘what is
the matter with me? I dreamed some one was
cutting my finger off. What was it? Oh! it
hurts me still!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“She held up the finger on which her mother
had placed the ring and tried to tear off the
golden band. ‘It burns—it burns!’ she cried.
‘Take it off.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her mother tried to take the ring off, but it
was some time before she succeeded. Her daughter
struggled and cried so that it was a hard matter
to remove the ring, which seemed to be as hot
as fire. A red blister was left on the girl’s finger,
and she was in great pain.</p>
<div id='i066'  class='figcenter id009'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>HER STEPMOTHER CREPT INTO THE ROOM</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“‘What have I done?’ the mother cried, seeing
her daughter’s condition. The two made so
much noise that Eolen awoke and went to the
door to find out what the trouble was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Go away, you hussy!’ screamed the stepmother
when she saw Eolen at the door. ‘Go
away! You are a witch!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, what have I done?’ Eolen asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You are the cause of all this trouble. For
amusement I placed your gold ring on my dear
daughter’s finger, and now see her condition!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, then, did you take my ring? If you
had left it where I placed it, you would have had
none of this trouble.’ Eolen spoke with so much
dignity that her stepmother was surprised into
silence, though she could talk faster and louder
than a flutter-mill. But finally she found her
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Go away! You are a witch!’ she said to
Eolen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Eolen went boldly into the room. ‘Give
me my ring!’ she exclaimed. ‘You shall wrong
me no further. Give me my ring! I will have
it!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“This roused the stepmother’s temper. She
searched on the floor till she found the ring.
Then she opened a window and flung it as far as
she could send it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now let’s see you get it!’ she cried. With
that she seized Eolen by the arm and pushed her
from the room, saying, ‘Go away, you witch!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, after
pausing to take breath, “what was the poor girl
to do?” He looked at Sweetest Susan as if
expecting her to answer the question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Sweetest
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shake up de bottle,” exclaimed Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Exactly so,” said Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope that isn’t all of the story,—if you
call it a story,” said Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which?” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger, with
an air of having forgotten the whole business.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, that about throwing the gold ring from
the window,” replied Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, no,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, in an absent-minded
way. “In a book, you know, you
can read right on if you want to, or you can put
the book down and rest yourself when you get
tired. But when I’m telling a story, you must
give me time to rest. I’m so little, you know,
that it doesn’t take much to tire me. Of course,
if you don’t like the story, I can stop any time.
It’s no trouble at all to stop. Just wink your
eye at me twice, and I’m mum.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, we don’t want you to stop,” said Sweetest
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, don’t stop,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, drowsily,
“because then everybody gets to talking,
and I can’t doze comfortably. Your stories are
as comforting to me as a feather-bed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I’ll add a bolster to the bed,” exclaimed
Mr. Thimblefinger. He hesitated a moment,
and then went on with the story:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, Eolen didn’t know what to do
when her stepmother threw the gold ring from
the window and pushed her from the room. She
went back to her bed and lay down, but she
couldn’t sleep. After a while daylight came,
and then she dressed herself and went down into
the garden to hunt for the ring. She searched
everywhere, but the ring was not to be found.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now the ring could have been found very
easily if it had been where it fell when Eolen’s
stepmother threw it from the window. But that
night a tame crow, belonging to the Prince of
that country, was roosting in one of the trees in
the garden.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, was it a sure enough Prince?” asked
Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, certainly,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger,
with great solemnity. “A make-believe Prince
could never have reigned in that country. The
people would have found him out, and he would
have been put in the calaboose. Well, this tame
crow that belonged to the Prince had wandered
off over the fields, and had gone so far away from
the palace that it was unable to get back before
dark, and so it went to bed in one of the trees
growing in the garden behind the house where
Eolen lived.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, as soon as morning came, the crow
was wide awake and ready for any mischief that
might turn up. It flew to the ground, hoping to
find something for breakfast, and hopped about,
searching in the leaves and grass. Suddenly the
crow saw the ring shining on the ground and
picked it up and turned it over. What could it
be? The crow’s curiosity was such that it forgot
all about breakfast. It seized the ring in its beak
and went flopping to the palace. It was so early
in the morning that the palace was closed, but the
crow flew straight to the Prince’s window and beat
his wings against it until some of the attendants
came and opened it, when the crow walked in
with great dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince had been awakened by the noise,
but when he saw the bird stalking into the room
as stiff as a major-general of militia, he fell back
on his bed laughing. The crow hopped to the
foot-board of the bed and stood there holding the
gold ring in his beak, as much as to say, ‘Don’t
you wish you were as rich as I am?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince rose from his bed and took the
ring from the crow, but it was so hot that he
made haste to drop it in a basin of cold water.
Then a curious thing happened. The ring seemed
to expand in the basin until it was as large as the
bottom, and within the circle it made the picture
of a beautiful girl standing by a milk-white cow.
There were two peculiarities about the milk-white
cow. Her ears were as black as jet, and her horns
shone and glittered as if they were made of gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince was entranced. He gazed at the
beautiful picture long and lovingly, and the crow
sat on the rim of the basin and chuckled as
proudly as if it had painted the picture. The
girl was the loveliest the Prince had ever seen, and
the cow was surely the most beautiful of her kind.
The Prince’s attendants uttered exclamations of
delight when they saw the picture, and his ministers,
when they were sent for, were struck dumb
with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘If this bird could only speak!’ cried the
Prince.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the crow went chuckling about the room
saying to itself, ‘What a fool a Prince must be
who cannot understand my simple language!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince gazed at the picture framed by
the gold ring for a long time. At last he concluded
to take it from the water. As he did so
it shrunk to its natural size, and the picture of
the beautiful girl and the Cow with the Golden
Horns disappeared, and the ring no longer burnt
his fingers. He dropped it in the basin once
more, but it remained a simple gold ring and the
picture failed to appear again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince was disconsolate. He remained
in the palace and refused to go out. He moped
and pined, until the family doctor was called in.
The doctor fussed about and felt of the Prince’s
pulse and looked at his tongue, and said that a
change of air was necessary; but the Prince said
he didn’t want any change of air and wouldn’t
have it. In fact, he said he didn’t want any air
at all, and he wouldn’t take any pills or powders,
and he wouldn’t drink any sage tea, and he
wouldn’t have any mustard plaster put on him.
He was in love, and he knew that the more medicine
he took, the worse off he would be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, a little sage tea ain’t bad when you are
in love,” remarked Mrs. Meadows. “It’s mighty
soothing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe,” continued Mr. Thimblefinger, “but
the Prince didn’t want it, and wouldn’t have it.
He wanted the beautiful girl he had seen in the
picture. He was in love with her, and he wanted
to marry her. So his ministers consulted together
and finally they sent around a bailiff”—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense!” cried Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tut—tut!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, “he sent a
crier around”—</p>

<p class='c013'>“A herald, you mean,” suggested Buster John,
who had read a good many story books.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bailiff could do the work just as well, but
you can have it your way. Well,” continued Mr.
Thimblefinger, “the Prince’s ministers sent a herald
around to inquire at all the people’s houses if
any of them had a Cow with Golden Horns, but
nobody had such a cow, and everybody wondered
what the herald meant. A Cow with Golden
Horns! People went about asking one another
if they had ever heard of such a thing before.
Some said the throne was tottering. Others said
the politicians were trying to work a scheme to
increase taxation. Still others talked about the
peril of the nation. Everybody had some explanation,
but nobody had the right one. The poor
young Prince was nearly crazy to find the young
girl whose picture he had seen in the basin of
water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For a few days the people heard no more of
the matter, but at the end of a week the herald
went round the city again declaring that the
Prince would marry any young lady who would
bring as her marriage portion a Cow with Golden
Horns. She need not have riches of any kind;
all that was necessary was a Cow with Golden
Horns. This word went around among the people
and from city to city. Rich men with daughters
tried everywhere to buy a Cow with Golden
Horns, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince waited and waited and pined and
grew thinner. But just as matters were getting
to be very serious indeed, an old man appeared
in the palace park leading a beautiful white cow
with jet black ears and golden horns. The servants
set up such a shout when they saw the beautiful
cow that everybody in the palace was aroused
and all came out to see what caused the noise.
Then the servants and attendants ran over one
another in their efforts to reach the Prince, who
was moping in his room. As they ran they
cried:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The Cow with the Golden Horns has come!
The Cow with the Golden Horns has come!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince forgot his dignity and hurried out
to see the Cow with the Golden Horns. The old
man came leading her, and she was, indeed, a
beautiful creature. Her head and limbs were almost
as delicate as those of a deer, and her eyes
were large and soft. Her body was as white as
snow, her ears glistened like black silk, and her
golden horns shone in the sun. The old man
bowed low as he led the beautiful cow forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I wouldn’t make much of a bride myself,
your Majesty,’ he said. ‘I have brought you the
Cow with the Golden Horns. She might find you
the bride that I failed to bring you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I fear I shall have no such good fortune,’
replied the Prince. ‘But I think you have proved
to me that I am not dreaming. How shall I
reward you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I ask no reward, your Majesty. I only ask
the privilege of taking away my Cow with the
Golden Horns when you have found your bride.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the Prince had given his promise, the
old man said, ‘You have a ring, your Majesty,
that came to you in a curious way. Let this ring
be placed on the left horn of the cow. The girl
or woman that is able to remove this ring will be
the bride you are wishing for. Every morning
the Cow with the Golden Horns will appear here
in the lawn and remain until night falls. Let
it be announced, your Majesty, that whoever
takes the ring from her shall be the Princess of
the Realm.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” exclaimed Drusilla suddenly. “He
talk like he been ter college.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you hush?” cried Buster John. But
Mr. Thimblefinger paid no attention to the
interruption.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But how do you know,’ asked the Prince,
‘that the right one will come to get the ring?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How do I know that your Majesty has the
ring?’ the old man answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This seemed to satisfy the Prince, who caused
it to be announced all through his kingdom that
he would choose for his bride the girl or woman
who would take the ring from the golden horn of
the Cow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course there was a great commotion among
the ladies when this announcement was made, and
nearly all of them tried to take the ring from the
golden horn of the Cow. Some said they tried it
just for fun, and some said they tried it just out
of curiosity; but all of them failed. Even Eolen’s
stepmother tried, and then she made her daughter
try, but when the daughter touched the ring it
burnt her so that she screamed. And then some
of those who had tried and failed turned up their
noses and said it was a trick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eolen had never thought of trying. She had
seen the Prince and admired him, yet she had no
idea of going up before all these people. But as
soon as her stepmother started for the palace with
her daughter, there came a knock at the door.
Eolen opened it, and there, standing before her,
was the old man who had carried her to the
Thunder’s house, and to the Jumping-Off Place.
She was very glad to see him, and told him so,
and he was just as glad to see her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why don’t you go and get your ring?’ he
asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It is lost,’ she answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It is found,’ he said. ‘I have placed it on
the golden horn of the Cow that stands near the
palace door. You must go and get it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I have nothing to wear,’ she replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the old man tapped on the wall and
called:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Sister Jane! Sister Jane! Where are
you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I am where I ought to be,’ was the reply.
The wall opened and out stepped the old, old
woman that Eolen had seen combing her hair by
the Well at the End of the World.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Clothe this child in silk and satin and comb
her hair out fine, Sister Jane.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old woman grumbled a little, but gave
Eolen a touch here and there, and in a moment
she was dressed as fine as the finest lady in the
land.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now she is ready, brother,’ said the old, old
woman, and then she disappeared in the wall,
combing her long gray hair and smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Must I walk?’ asked Eolen, looking at her
satin slippers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Nonsense!’ exclaimed the old man. Then
he tapped in another part of the wall. ‘Nephew!
Nephew! Where are you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Wherever you wish me to be,’ a voice replied,
and then the wall opened, and out stepped
the handsome stranger who had given Eolen the
gold ring. ‘What do you want?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘A carriage and horses,’ said the old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘They are at the door,’ was the reply, ‘and
I’ll drive them myself.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure enough, there stood at the door a coach
and four, and Eolen was carried to the palace
in grand style. Liveried servants appeared and
spread a strip of carpet before her, and the Cow
with the Golden Horns came running to meet her,
and in a moment she had the ring. Then the
people set up a loud shout, crying:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The Princess! the Princess!’</p>
<div id='i080'  class='figcenter id010'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SHE WOULD HAVE KNELT, BUT HE LIFTED HER UP</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“And then the Prince came out and went to
her. She would have knelt, but he lifted her up
and knelt himself before her, and kissed her hand,
and smiled on her, for she was the lovely girl he
had seen in the picture.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the moral of that?” inquired Mr.
Rabbit, waking from his nap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you didn’t even hear the story,” said
Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is the reason I want to hear the moral
of it,” remarked Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no moral at all,” said Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I’m mighty glad I was asleep,” grumbled
Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c007'>VIII.<br /> <br />BROTHER WOLF’S TWO BIG DINNERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The children said they were very much pleased
with the story about the Cow with the Golden
Horns. Buster John even went so far as to say
that it was as good as some of the stories in the
books. But Mr. Thimblefinger shook his head.
He said he was very glad they were pleased with
it, but he knew Mr. Rabbit was right. The story
couldn’t be a very good story, because it had no
moral.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I think it had a very good moral,” remarked
Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was it?” inquired Mr. Rabbit with
great solemnity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, if the little girl had been too stingy to
give the old beggar a piece of her cake, she would
never have come to be Princess,” replied Mrs.
Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did she give the beggar a piece of cake?”
asked Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, certainly she did,” Mr. Thimblefinger
answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, setting himself
back in his chair, “I must have been fast asleep
when she did it. But the place for a moral, as
I’ve been told, is right at the end of a story, and
not at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can’t you tell us a story with a moral?” suggested
Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can,” replied Mr. Rabbit. “I can for a
fact, and the piece of cake you mentioned puts
me in mind of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit closed his eyes and rubbed his nose,
and then began:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once upon a time, when Brother Fox and
myself were living on pretty good terms with each
other, we received an invitation to attend a barbecue
that Brother Wolf was going to give on the
following Saturday. The next day we received
an invitation to a barbecue that Brother Bear was
going to give on the same Saturday.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I made up my mind at once to go to Brother
Bear’s barbecue, because I knew he would have
fresh roasting ears, and if there’s anything I
like better than another, it is fresh roasting ears.
I asked Brother Fox whether he was going to
Brother Bear’s barbecue or to Brother Wolf’s,
but he shook his head. He said he hadn’t
made up his mind. I just asked him out of idle
curiosity, for I didn’t care whether he went or
whether he stayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I went about my work as usual. Cold weather
was coming on, and I wanted to get my crops in
before the big freeze came. But I noticed that
Brother Fox was mighty restless in his mind. He
didn’t do a stroke of work. He’d sit down and
then he’d get up; he’d stand still and look up
in the tops of the trees, and then he’d walk back
and forth with his hands behind him and look
down at the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I says to him, says I, ‘I hope you are not
sick, Brother Fox.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘Oh, no, Brother Rabbit; I never
felt better in my life.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I says to him, says I, ‘I hope money matters
are not troubling you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘Oh, no, Brother Rabbit, money was
never easier with me than it is this season.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I says to him, says I, ‘I hope I’ll have the
pleasure of your company to the barbecue to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘I can’t tell, Brother Rabbit; I can’t
tell. I haven’t made up my mind. I may go to
the one, or I may go to the other; but which
it will be, I can’t tell you to save my life.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the next day was Saturday, I was up
bright and early. I dug my goobers and spread
’em out to dry in the sun, and then, ten o’clock,
as near as I could judge, I started out to the barbecue.
Brother Wolf lived near the river, and
Brother Bear lived right on the river, a mile or
two below Brother Wolf’s. The big road, that
passed near where Brother Fox and I lived, led in
the direction of the river for about three miles,
and then it forked, one prong going to Brother
Wolf’s house, and the other prong going to Brother
Bear’s house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, when I came to the forks of the road,
who should I see there but old Brother Fox. I
stopped before he saw me, and watched him. He
went a little way down one road, and licked his
chops; then he came back and went a little way
down the other road, and licked his chops.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not choosing to be late, I showed myself and
passed the time of day with Brother Fox. I said,
says I, that if he was going to Brother Bear’s barbecue,
I’d be glad to have his company. But he
said, says he, that he wouldn’t keep me waiting.
He had just come down to the forks of the road
to see if that would help him to make up his mind.
I told him I was mighty sorry to miss his company
and his conversation, and then I tipped my
hat and took my cane from under my arm and
went down the road that led to Brother Bear’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here Mr. Rabbit paused, straightened himself
up a little, and looked at the children. Then he
continued:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon you all never stood on the top of a
hill three quarters of a mile from the smoking pits
and got a whiff or two of the barbecue?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I is! I is!” exclaimed Drusilla. “Don’t talk!
Hit make me dribble at de mouf. I wish I had
some right now.”</p>
<div id='i086'  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i086.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>HE WENT A LITTLE WAY DOWN ONE ROAD</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Mr. Rabbit, “I got a whiff of it
and I was truly glad I had come—truly glad. It
was a fine barbecue, too. There was lamb, and
kid, and shote, all cooked to a turn and well seasoned,
and then there was the hash made out of
the giblets. I’ll not tell you any more about the
dinner, except that I’d like to have one like it
every Saturday in the year. If I happened to be
too sick to eat it, I could sit up and look at it.
Anyhow, we all had enough and to spare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After we had finished with the barbecue and
were sitting in Brother Bear’s front porch smoking
our pipes and talking politics, I happened to
mention to Brother Bear something about Brother
Wolf’s barbecue. I said, says I, that I thought
I’d go by Brother Wolf’s house as I went on
home, though it was a right smart step out of the
way, just to see how the land lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Bear, says he: ‘If you’ll wait
till my company take their leave, I don’t mind
trotting over to Brother Wolf’s with you. The
walk will help to settle my dinner.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, about two hours by sun, we started out
and went to Brother Wolf’s house. Brother Bear
knew a short cut through the big canebrake, and
it didn’t take us more than half an hour to get
there. Brother Wolf was just telling his company
good-by; and when they had all gone he
would have us go in and taste his mutton stew,
and then he declared he’d think right hard of us
if we didn’t drink a mug or two of his persimmon
beer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said, says I, ‘Brother Wolf, have you seen
Brother Fox to-day?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Wolf said, says he, ‘I declare, I
haven’t seen hair nor hide of Brother Fox. I
don’t see why he didn’t come. He’s always
keen to go where there’s fresh meat a-frying.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said, says I, ‘The reason I asked was because
I left Brother Fox at the forks of the road
trying to make up his mind whether he’d eat at
your house or at Brother Bear’s.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, I’m mighty sorry,’ says Brother Wolf,
says he; ‘Brother Fox never missed a finer chance
to pick a bone than he’s had to-day. Please tell
him so for me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said I would, and then I told Brother Wolf
and Brother Bear good-by and set out for home.
Brother Wolf’s persimmon beer had a little age
on it, and it made me light-headed and nimble-footed.
I went in a gallop, as you may say, and
came to the forks of the road before the sun went
down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may not believe it, but when I got there
Brother Fox was there going through the same
motions that made me laugh in the morning—running
down one road and licking his chops,
and then running down the other and licking his
chops.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘I hope you had a good dinner at
Brother Wolf’s to-day, Brother Fox.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘I’ve had no dinner.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘That’s mighty funny. Brother Bear
had a famous barbecue, and I thought Brother
Wolf was going to have one, too.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Fox, ‘Is dinner over? Is it
too late to go?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘Why, Brother Fox, the sun’s nearly
down. By the time you get to Brother Bear’s
house, he’ll be gone to bed; and by the time you
go across the swamp to Brother Wolf’s house, the
chickens will be crowing for day.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, well, well!’ says Brother Fox, ‘I’ve
been all day trying to make up my mind which
road I’d take, and now it’s too late.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that was the fact,” continued Mr. Rabbit.
“The poor creature had been all day trying
to make up his mind which road he’d take. Now,
then, what is the moral?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sweetest Susan looked at Mrs. Meadows, but
Mrs. Meadows merely smiled. Buster John rattled
the marbles in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?” inquired Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go down one road an’ git one dinner, den cut
’cross an’ git some mo’ dinner, an’ den go back
home down de yuther road.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tar-Baby, you are wrong,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you want anything, go and get it,” suggested
Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit shook his head and looked at Sweetest
Susan, whereupon she said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you can’t make up your mind, you’ll have
to go hungry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eat a good breakfast,” said Mrs. Meadows,
“and you won’t be worried about your dinner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All wrong!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit, with a
chuckle. “The moral is this: He who wants
too much is more than likely to get nothing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” remarked Mrs. Meadows dubiously,
“if you have to work out a moral as if it was a
sum in arithmetic, I’ll thank you not to trouble
me with any more morals.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The motion is seconded and carried,” exclaimed
Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

you are telling them. It’s my habit to sit and
nod at certain hours of the day, and if you’ll
watch me right close, you’ll see that I sometimes
drop off when I’m telling a story myself. I’ll
try and keep awake the next time you tell one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m afraid I’ll have to prop Mr. Rabbit’s
eyelids open with straws,” said Mrs. Meadows,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll just try you with a little one,” Mr. Thimblefinger
declared. “I’ll tell you one I heard
when I was younger. I want to see whether
Mr. Rabbit will keep awake, and I want to see
whether there’s a moral in the tale.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So he took off his little hat, which was shaped
like a thimble, and run his hand over the feather
ornament to straighten it out. Then he began:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“A long time ago, when there was a great deal
more room in the country next door than there is
now, there lived a man who had a wife, one son,
a horse, a cow, and a calf. He was a hard-working
man, so much so that he had little or no time
to devote to his family. He worked hard in the
field all day, and when night came he was too
tired to trouble much about his son. His wife,
too, having no servant, was always busy about the
house, sewing, washing, cooking, cleaning, patching,
milking, and sweeping. Day in and day out
it was always the same. The man was always
working, and the woman was always working.
They had no rest except on Sunday, and then
they were too tired to pay much attention to their
son.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The consequence was, that while the boy was
a very bright lad, he was full of mischief, up to
all sorts of tricks and pranks that some people call
meanness. By hook or by crook—or maybe by
book—he had learned how to spell and read.
But the only book he had to read was one with
big pictures of men dressed in red clothes, and
armed with yellow cutlasses. The book was called
‘The Pirooters of Peruvia.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe the name was ‘The Pirates of Peru,’”
suggested Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger. “I
don’t suppose any such country as Peru had been
found on the map when that book was written.
But never mind about that. The boy read only
that book, and he became rather wild in his mind.
He wanted to be a pirooter, whatever that was,
and so he armed himself with old hoe helves and
called them pikes, and he tied a shingle to his
side and called it a cutlass, and he got him a
broom-handle and called it a horse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This boy’s name was Johnny, but sometimes
they called him Jack for short. Some people said
he was mean as he could be; but I don’t say that.
He was fonder of scampering over the country
than he was of helping his mother. Maybe he
didn’t know any better because he wasn’t taught
any better. But one morning his mother was so
tired that she couldn’t get out of bed. She had
worn herself out with work. The next morning
she couldn’t get up, nor the next; and then the
neighbors, who had come in to see what the matter
was, said that she would never get up any
more. So one day Johnny found everything very
still in the house, and the neighbors who were
there were kinder to him than they ever had been,
and then he knew that his mother would never
get tired any more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He felt so bad that he wandered off into the
woods, crying as he went. His eyes were so full
of tears that he couldn’t see where he was going,
and he didn’t care. He went on and on, until,
finally, when he took heart to look around, he
found himself in a part of the country that was
new to him. This caused him to dry his eyes, for
he was perfectly sure that he had traveled neither
fast nor far enough to be beyond the limits of the
numberless journeys he had made in all directions
from his father’s house; and yet, here he was,
suddenly and without knowing how he got there,
in a country that was altogether new to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was just like when you came down through
our spring gate,” said Mr. Thimblefinger. “The
grass was different and the trees were different,
and even the sand and the gravel were of a color
that Johnny had never seen before. Suddenly,
while he was wondering how he could have missed
seeing all these strange things when he had journeyed
this way before, a lady, richly dressed, came
out of the woods and stood before him. She
neither smiled nor looked severe, but pity seemed
to shine in her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What now?’ she said, raising her hand to
her head. ‘You have come fast and come far.
You are in trouble. Go back. When you want
me, go to the Whispering Poplar that stands on
the hill and call my name.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Who are you?’ asked Johnny, forgetting to
be polite, if he ever knew how.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The Keeper of the Cows that roam in the
night,’ replied the lady. ‘When you go to the
Whispering Poplar that stands on the hill, whisper
this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O Keeper of Cows that roam in the night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come over the hill and lend me your light.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Johnny would have thanked the woman, but
in the twinkling of an eye she was gone without
making a sound, and not a blade of grass shook
to show that she had been there. Johnny turned
in his tracks and started home the way he came.
Before he had gone far he stopped to look back,
but the strange country was nowhere to be seen—only
the old familiar hills and trees that he had
always known.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When he got home there was a strange woman
cooking and fixing his father’s supper. The table
was set, and everything was almost as neat and as
tidy as it used to be when his mother was alive.
Even his own little plate was in its place, and his
mug, with the picture of a blue castle painted on
it, was by the plate. But Johnny had no appetite.
He went to the door and looked in, and then went
to the stable. Once there, he suddenly remembered
that he had forgotten to drive the cow in
from the pasture. He went running to get her,
but found her coming along of her own accord,
something she was not in the habit of doing.</p>
<div id='i096'  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/i096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A LADY, RICHLY DRESSED, CAME OUT OF THE WOODS</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Johnny wondered a little at this, but it soon
passed out of his mind, and he got behind the
cow and made her go faster. He drove the cow
into the lot, and waited awhile for the woman to
come and milk. But she delayed so long that he
went to the house and found his father eating
supper. Instead of going to the table, he went
and sat by the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Have something to eat?’ said the woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I am not hungry,’ he replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Have a glass of fresh milk, then?’ she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not to-night,’ he answered. ‘I have just
driven the cow in from the pasture.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I brought her from the pasture myself,’ said
the woman, ‘milked her, and turned her out
again.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Johnny said nothing to this, but he knew
the cow had not been milked, and he wondered
where the woman got the milk that his father was
drinking. He thought it over, and forgot all
about his grief. He noticed that as soon as his
father drank the milk he began to smile at the
woman. He smiled at the woman, but was cross
to Johnny.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After supper the woman went out, and after
a while Johnny went out, too, leaving his father
sitting by the fire smoking his pipe. Johnny
went to the lot, thinking the woman had gone
there. He wanted to see whether she would milk
the cow. He crept along the side of the fence,
and soon he was near enough to peep through a
crack without being seen. He saw the woman
rubbing the cow on the back while the calf was
getting all the milk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You see how good I am to you, sister,’ said
she. ‘Now I want you to be good to me. When
that boy Jack goes after you to the pasture,
I want you to lead him a chase. I saw him beating
your calf to-day. But see how good I am to
your calf, sister. I give it all the milk.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The cow shook her horn and switched her
tail, and Johnny, sitting in the fence corner, wondered
what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I see,’ said the cow, after a while. ‘You
want to marry the boy’s father, and the boy is in
the way. But suppose they find you out. What
then?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Trust me for that, sister,’ said the woman;
‘trust me for that.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Johnny waited to hear no more, but crept
away and went to bed. He was dressed and out
by sun-up next morning, but the woman was
up before him, and had breakfast nearly ready.
Johnny asked her if she had milked the cow, and
she replied that she had milked and forgotten
about it. Johnny saw the milk-pail setting on the
shelf, and when he looked at it he knew the cow
had not been milked, else the sides of the pail
would have been spattered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the cow had been turned out, and the
calf was sleeping contentedly in the fence corner,
instead of nibbling the grass. Johnny drank no
milk at breakfast, but his father did, and smiled
at the woman more than ever. During the day
Johnny forgot all about the cow, but when night
came he knew she must be brought up, so he went
to the pasture after her. She was not to be found.
He hunted over the hills and fields, and then, not
finding her, began to cry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suddenly the lady he had seen the day before
stepped out of the wood and spoke to him. She
held in her hand a tiny lantern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Take this,’ she said, holding out the lantern.
‘You wouldn’t call me, and so I came to you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I forgot,’ whispered Johnny.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t forget any more,’ said the lady.
‘Take this lantern and run to the Whispering
Poplar that stands on the hill. You’ll find your
cow tied there. Drive her home, and don’t spare
her.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Johnny found the cow tied to the poplar sure
enough, and he made her gallop home as fast as
she could. He blew out his tiny lantern before
he got in sight of the house, but it dropped from
his hand and he could find it no more. He ceased
to hunt for it after a while, and drove the cow to
the lot, where the woman was waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Go get your supper,’ she said to Johnny.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes ’m,’ replied Johnny, but he went off
only to creep back to see what the woman would
do.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She abused the cow terribly. He could see
that she was angry. ‘You are a nice sister,’ she
exclaimed, ‘to let that boy bring you home so
early.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t “sister” me,’ moaned the cow. ‘I’m
nearly famished, and that boy has nearly run me
off my legs. Somebody that I couldn’t see
caught me and tied me to a tree this morning, and
there I’ve been all day. We’d better go away
from here. That boy will find you out yet.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then Johnny crept away, ate his supper, and
went to bed. He slept late the next morning, but
when he awoke he found that his father, instead
of being at work, as was his habit, was smoking
his pipe and talking to the woman, and both were
smiling at each other very sweetly. That afternoon,
Johnny went to bring the cow home before
sundown, but he couldn’t find her. He hunted
and hunted for her until long after dark, and then
he went to the Whispering Poplar that stands on
the hill, and said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘O Keeper of Cows that roam in the night,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Come over the hills and lend me your light!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Instantly Johnny heard a cow lowing in the
valley, and saw a light glimmering faintly in the
distance. In a little while he heard a tremendous
clatter of hoofs up the hill, and the rushing of
some large animal through the bushes. It seemed
to have one eye only and that eye shone as fiercely
as a flame of fire as its head swayed from side to
side. It came rushing to the poplar-tree where
Johnny stood, and stopped there. Johnny peeped
from behind the tree and saw that the frightful
animal was nothing more than his cow, with a tiny
lantern hanging on her horn. She stood there
panting and trembling. Johnny waited to see
if the Keeper of Cows that roam in the night
would make her appearance, but he waited in vain.
Then he drove the cow home, turned her into
the lot, and went in the house to get his supper.
His father and the woman were sitting very close
together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Have you brought the cow?’ the woman
asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘She’s in the lot,’ replied Johnny.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You are a smart boy,’ said the woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Thanky, ma’am,’ exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So it went on day after day. The woman
would make the cow wander farther and farther
away from home, and Johnny would go to the
Whispering Poplar that stands on the hill and call
for the beautiful lady, the Keeper of the Cows
that roam in the night, and soon the cow would
come running and lowing. Then Johnny would
drive her home by the light of his little lantern.
This happened so often that the neighbors, and
indeed the people in all that country, when they
saw a light bobbing around at night, would shake
their heads and say, ‘There goes Jack with his
lantern,’ and then after a while they called him
‘Jack of the Lantern.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“One day he heard two of the neighbors talking
about him, saying it was a pity that so bright
a boy should have such a stepmother as the woman
his father was about to marry. Then Johnny (or
Jack, as he was sometimes called) knew that his
father was preparing to marry the woman who
was keeping house for him, and it made the boy
feel very wretched to think that this woman was
to take the place of his mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That very day he went to the Whispering Poplar
that stands on the hill and called for the Keeper
of the Cows that roam in the night. The lady
made her appearance, and then Johnny told her
his troubles. The lady smiled for the first time.
Then she told Johnny that if he would follow her
directions his troubles would disappear. She gave
him a roll of blue ribbon, and told him what to
say when he presented it to the woman just before
the marriage took place. She told him also what
to do with his little lantern. Johnny went home
feeling very much better, and that night his father
told him he was to have a new mother the next
day. He said nothing in reply, but smiled as if
the news pleased him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Johnny lay awake that night a long time, and
once he thought the woman came and leaned over
his bed as if to listen, but just then a cow not far
away lowed once, twice, thrice. Then the woman
went away muttering something.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The next day the invited guests began to assemble
early, and after a while the preacher came.
The women neighbors would have the bride to
stand up in the middle of the floor to admire her
just before the ceremony, and when she stood up
Johnny began to march around her, waving his
lantern and his blue ribbon and singing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I have for the bride ten yards of blue ribbon—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ten yards of blue ribbon, ten yards of blue ribbon—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I have for the bride ten yards of blue ribbon,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So rich and so soft and so rare;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Five yards to pin on her snowy white bosom—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her snowy white bosom, her snowy white bosom—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Five yards to pin on her snowy white bosom,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And five to tie in her hair.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I have a lantern to light her along with—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To light her along with, to light her along with—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I have a lantern to light her along with,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When forth she fares in the night;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Out in the dark, the ribbon will rustle—</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The ribbon will rustle, the ribbon will rustle—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Out in the dark the ribbon will rustle,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the lantern will lend her its light!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Johnny threw the blue ribbon over the
woman’s shoulder and around her neck, and
waved his lantern, and instantly the woman disappeared,
and in her place stood a cow. Before
the people could recover their surprise, the lady
that Johnny had seen at the Whispering Poplar
came into the room and bowed to the company.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘This is the most malicious cow in all my
herd,’ said she, ‘and this brave boy has caught
her. Here is a purse of gold for his reward. As
for you, sir,’ turning to Johnny’s father, ‘you
may thank your son for saving you from this
witch.’ Then she bowed again, and went away,
leading the cow, and neither of them was ever
seen in that country again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But to this day, when people see a light bobbing
up and down in the fields at night, they say,
‘Yonder’s Jack of the Lantern!’”</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>X.<br /> <br />A LUCKY CONJURER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Now, I think that was a pretty good story,”
said Mr. Rabbit. “It had something about cows
in it, and there was nothing about kings and
princes. I wouldn’t give <i>that</i>”—Mr. Rabbit
blew a whiff of smoke from his mouth—“or all
your princes and kings. Of course that’s on account
of my ignorance. I don’t know anything
about them. I reckon they are just as good
neighbors as anybody, when you come to know
them right well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John laughed at this, but Sweetest
Susan only smiled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I am not joking,” remarked Mr. Rabbit
solemnly. “There’s no reason why kings and
queens and princes shouldn’t be just as neighborly
as other people. If a king and queen were
keeping house anywhere near me, and were to
send over after a mess of salad, or to borrow a
cup of sugar or a spoonful of lard, I’d be as ready
to accommodate them as I would any other neighbors,
and I reckon they’d do the same by me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’d be mighty foolish if they didn’t,”
said Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hear tell dat folks hafter be monstus umble-come-tumble
when dey go foolin’ ’roun’ whar dey
er kingin’ an’ a queenin’ at,” remarked Drusilla.
“Ef dey sont me fer ter borry any sugar er
lard fum de house whar dey does de kingin’ an’
queenin’, I boun’ you I’d stan’ at the back gate
an’ holler ’fo’ I went in dar whar dey wuz a-havin’
der gwines on. Dey wouldn’t git me in dar ’fo’
I know’d how de lan’ lay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I expect you are right, Tar-Baby,” replied
Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’m glad you didn’t go to sleep over
the story of the little boy and the lantern. But
it didn’t have any moral,” said Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I reckon that’s the reason I didn’t do
any nodding,” explained Mr. Rabbit. “I knew
there was something the matter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a pause, during which Mr. Rabbit
betrayed a tendency to fall to nodding again.
Presently Mrs. Meadows remarked:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I mind me of a story that I heard once—I
reckon the talk about kings and queens made me
remember it. Anyway, it popped into my head
all of a sudden, though I hadn’t thought about
it in years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fire away!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit, opening
his eyes and slowly closing them again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once upon a time there lived in the land of
Moraria a man who was very poor. He worked
whenever and wherever he could find work, yet
he had so many children that even if he had found
work every day he could have made hardly enough
for all to eat and wear. As it was, times were so
hard and work was so scarce that he frequently
had to go hungry and half clothed. His wife did
the best she could, which was very little. She
worked about the palace where the king had lived,
but as she was only one among a hundred, she
got small wages, and had few opportunities to
carry any scraps of victuals to her children.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finally the man came to the conclusion that
he must make a desperate effort to better his condition,
so he said to his wife:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What are my five senses for? I see other
people living by their wits, and dressing fine and
enjoying the best in the land. Why shouldn’t
I do the same? What is to prevent me but my
stupidity?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Stupidity is a high fence to climb over,’ replied
the man’s wife. ‘But if you are willing to
try how far your wits will carry you, you will
have a good opportunity in a few days. The
king’s daughter, the Princess Myla, is to be married
next week, and even now the guests are assembling
at the palace—most of them belonging
to the bridegroom’s retinue.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man leaned his head on his hand and
thought a while, and then he rose and put on the
best clothes he had, which were poor enough, and
tied a rope girdle around his waist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I shall go to court as a pilgrim,’ he said to
his wife. ‘When you see me, do you go around
among the other servants and tell them that a
great conjurer has arrived from the East. In
this way it will come quickly to the King’s ears.
Nothing will come of that, but the next morning
something valuable will be missing from the palace.
When you hear of it, do you tell the rest
that you know a man who can find whatever is
missing.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But how will you do this?’ asked the woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Leave that to me,’ he replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man carried out his plan, and his wife followed
his directions. She pointed him out to her
fellow-servants as a great conjurer from the East.
Ragged as he was, the man stalked majestically
about the palace-yard, and after a while sat on the
ground with his face to the wall, and shook his
head from side to side, and made many queer motions
with his hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, while the man sat there going through
his queer motions, he heard voices on the other
side of the wall. He judged that two men were
resting in the shade on that side, and he knew by
the way they talked that they had come with the
young Prince who was to marry the Princess
Myla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You have left the blanket on the horse, I
hope,’ said one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes, everything is attended to,’ replied the
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is well,’ remarked the first. ‘The
Prince, our master, desires the Princess Myla to
be the first to look on this beautiful horse, which
has just come out of Arabia. I will go myself
to see that the animal is properly cared for.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Presently two strangers came through the
gate, laughing and talking, and the man who was
playing the conjurer knew they were the keepers
of the horse. He rose when they went by, and
watched them until he saw what part of the palace
stables they entered. Then he slowly made
his way out of the palace grounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That night he went back and removed the
horse, placing it where no one would be likely
to find it. Then he told his wife what he had
done.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There will be a great outcry,’ said he, ‘when
the horse is missed. In the midst of it make your
voice heard, and remind the young Prince’s attendants
that there is a famous conjurer within
reach who can no doubt find the horse.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the man said, so it turned out. There
was a great noise made when it was found that
the beautiful Arabian horse had been stolen. The
young Prince was ready to tear his hair, so great
was his disappointment. He offered a large sum
of money to any one who would recover the horse.
When the excitement was at its highest, the
woman mentioned to some of the attendants that
a famous conjurer had come to the palace. She
then pointed her husband out to the men. At
once the news was carried to the Prince, who was
with the King.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The King was not a believer in conjurers, and
he quickly told the attendants to go send the vagabond
about his business. But the young Prince
was so keen to recover the beautiful horse which
he had intended as a wedding gift for the Princess
Myla that he insisted on consulting the conjurer.
So the man was sent for. He came, followed by
a number of people who were anxious to see what
he would do. He had a very wise look as he
bowed to the King and to the Prince.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Who are you?’ the King asked with a
frown.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘A poor pilgrim, your Majesty. Nothing
more.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What is your business?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I am a student, your Majesty.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where are your books?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘In men’s faces, your Majesty.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man’s replies were so apt that the King’s
ill-humor partly passed away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘A horse has been stolen from the royal
stables,’ said the King. ‘I am told you are a conjurer.
If you are, find the horse.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man seated himself on the carpet, drew
a crystal stone from his pocket, and asked the
young Prince to warm it in the palm of his hand.
Then the man took it and looked at it a few moments,
rubbing his hand over it as if something
blurred his sight. Then he said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The horse has on a blanket woven on a Russian
loom. I see! A dapple-gray with milk-white
mane and tail.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is the horse!’ cried the Prince.
‘Where is he?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘He is tied in a thicket a half league from
here, near a road that leads to the river. He
paws the ground and whinnies for his master.
He is hungry.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“At once messengers were sent and the horse
found. The Prince was about to give the man
a purse of gold, but the King stayed his hand,
saying:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’ll test this fellow. I believe he is an imposter.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man was very much frightened at this,
but there was no escape for him. The King went
to his private apartment, and shortly came back
with a covered basket in his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There is a bird in this nest,’ said the King.
‘If you are a conjurer, tell me the name of
it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Alas, your Majesty,’ cried the man, preparing
to fall on his knees and beg for mercy, ‘a
nest that wouldn’t fit a sparrow might chance to
fit a crow.’</p>
<div id='i114'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i114.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>AS HE DID SO, A CROW HOPPED OUT</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“‘You certainly have gifts,’ remarked the King
as he lifted the cover from the basket. As he
did so a crow hopped out and went stalking about
the room. The man was more astonished than
the King. In his fright he had hit on an old
saying that he had often heard, and it saved his
life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Prince gave the man a purse of gold and
he was about to retire, when suddenly an attendant
came running into the chamber crying that
some one had stolen the beautiful diamond ring
belonging to the Princess Myla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Tell the Princess to trouble herself no further.
We have here a man who will be able to
find it,’ said the King.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Allow me a little time, your Majesty,’ cried
the man, who was now frightened nearly out of
his wits. ‘Let me go into a vacant room in a
quiet part of the palace, where I may have an
opportunity to look into this matter.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was soon placed in a room near the servants’
quarters, the attendants telling him that
he would be summoned by the King in an hour.
He went into the room, shut the door, and flung
himself on the floor, bewailing his unhappy condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now the ring had been stolen by one of the
women in attendance on the Princess. She was
so pale and sad-looking that her companions had
nicknamed her Misery, and sometimes the Princess
herself, in a spirit of fun, called her by that
name. She had heard how the conjurer had discovered
the stolen horse, and she had seen him
name the crow in the covered basket. Consequently
she was very much frightened when she
heard the King command him to find the stolen
ring. She saw the conjurer go into the room, and
after a while she crept to the door to listen, so
great was her fear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man in the room was not thinking of the
stolen ring at all. He was merely bewailing his
unhappy lot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, misery, misery!’ he cried; ‘I have
heard of you, but now I know you!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“He had no sooner said this than there came
a knock on the door and a voice said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t talk so loud! Open the door!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man opened the door and saw a woman
standing there trembling and weeping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t expose me,’ she said, ‘but spare my
life. I have the ring here. I did wrong to steal
it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“For a moment the man was so overcome with
astonishment that he was unable to speak. He
took the ring in his hand and looked at it while
the woman continued to plead with him. He
handed her the ring again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Take it,’ he said, ‘and place it beneath the
corner of one of the rugs in the bedroom of the
Princess. Be quick about it, for I am going to
the King.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The woman ran and did as she had been told,
and then the man came from the room and sent
an attendant to inform the King that the ring had
been found. The King sent for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where is the ring?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Under a corner of a rug in the bedroom of
the Princess, your Majesty,’ replied the man, bowing
low and smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Search was at once made, and sure enough
the beautiful ring was found under a corner of a
rug in the Princess’s bedroom. The Princess herself
came to thank the conjurer, and if he had not
been a very sensible man his head would have
been turned by the attention he received. Even
the King no longer doubted the conjurer’s powers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There is something in this man,’ said the
King, and he straightway offered him a high position
among his councilors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man thanked the King most heartily, but
declared that his business would not allow him to
remain another day at court. So the King gave
him a purse of gold, the young Prince gave him
another, and the beautiful Princess Myla gave
him a string of pearls of great value. Then he
went home, bought him some land, built him a
comfortable house, and went into business for himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It sometimes happened that his wife complained
because he did not accept the King’s offer
and remain at court, so that she might have flourished
as a fine lady, but he always replied by saying
that the man is a fool who will tempt Providence
more than three times in a lifetime. Though
he went into the palace poor and came out of it
rich, he had escaped only by the skin of his teeth.
He was always grateful for his good fortune,
and by his example taught his children to lead
virtuous lives and always to help the poor and
needy.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>XI.<br /> <br />THE KING OF THE CLINKERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Chickamy Crany Crow and Tickle-My-Toes
had stopped frolicking, and were now listening to
the stories. While Mrs. Meadows was telling
about the lucky conjurer, Tickle-My-Toes became
very uneasy. He moved about restlessly, pulled
off his big straw hat, put it on again, and seemed
to be waiting impatiently for the time to come
when he might say something.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, when Mrs. Meadows had finished, she looked
at Tickle-My-Toes to see what he wanted. The
rest did the same. But Tickle-My-Toes blushed
very red, and looked at his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You acted as if you wanted to say something,”
said Mrs. Meadows, “and if you do, now’s
your chance. What’s the matter? Have you
run a splinter in your foot? You look as if you
wanted to cry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did want to say something,” replied Tickle-My-Toes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was it?” Mrs. Meadows inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” answered Tickle-My-Toes,
putting his finger in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I declare, I’m ashamed of you,” exclaimed
Mrs. Meadows. “Here you are mighty near as
old as I am, and yet trying to play boo-hoo baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t think you ought to talk that way,”
said Tickle-My-Toes. “I thread your needles
for you every day, and I do everything you ask
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know what’s the matter with you,” remarked
Mrs. Meadows. “You want me to take
you in my lap and rock you to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I don’t!” cried Tickle-My-Toes, blushing
again. “I wanted to tell a story I heard,
but I’ll go off somewhere and tell it to myself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There wouldn’t be any fun in that,” suggested
Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Mrs. Meadows. “Tell the story
right here, so we can enjoy it with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ll laugh,” protested Tickle-My-Toes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not unless there’s something in the story to
laugh at.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is no laughing story. It’s just as solemn
as it can be,” explained Tickle-My-Toes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit. “If there’s
anything I like, it is one of those solemn stories
that make you feel like you want to go off behind
the house and shake hands with yourself, and cry
boo-hoo to the ell-and-yard and seven stars.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit’s enthusiastic remark was very encouraging
to Tickle-My-Toes, who, after scratching
his head a little, and looking around to see if
he could find a place to hide when the time came,
began his story in this wise:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once upon a time, and in a big town away
off yonder somewhere, there lived a little boy who
had no father nor mother. He was so small that
nobody seemed to care anything about him. But
one day a woman, the wife of a baker, heard him
crying in the streets, and carried him into the
house, and gave him something to eat, and warmed
him by the fire, and after that he felt better.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The baker himself grumbled a great deal
when he came home and found what his wife had
done. He said he wouldn’t be surprised to come
home some day and find his house full of other
people’s children. But his wife replied that it
would be well enough to complain when he found
the house full. As for this little brat, she said,
he wouldn’t fill a milk jar if he was put in it,
much less a great big house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The baker growled and grumbled, but his
wife paid no attention to him. She sat in her
chair and rocked and sang, and was just as good-natured
as she could be. After a while the baker
himself got over his grumbling, and began to
laugh. He told his wife that he had sold all his
bread that day, and had orders for as much the
next day.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Of course,’ said she; ‘but if I had left that
child crying in the streets your business would
have been ruined before the year is out.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Maybe so,’ replied the baker.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the little boy grew very fast, and was
as lively as a cricket. The baker’s wife thought
as much of him as if he had been her own son,
and the baker himself soon came to be very fond
of him. He was very smart, too. He learned to
watch the fire under the big oven, and to make
himself useful in many ways. He played about
the oven so much, and was so fond of watching
the bread bake and the fire burn, that the baker’s
wife called him Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For many years the country where the baker
and his wife and Sparkle Spry lived had been at
peace with all the other countries. But one day
a man from a neighboring country had his nose
pulled by somebody in the baker’s country, and
then war was declared by the kings and queens,
and the people fell to fighting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, when people fight they must be fed,
and the cheapest thing to feed them on is bread.
A part of the army camped near the town where
the baker lived, and there was a great demand for
bread. The baker’s oven was not a large one,
and by running it day and night he could only
bake three hundred loaves.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He and his wife baked until they were tired
out. They told Sparkle Spry to watch the oven
so that the bread wouldn’t burn, and to wake
them when it was brown. They were so tired
that Sparkle Spry was sorry for them, and he wondered
why he wasn’t big enough to take their
places, if only for one day and night. While he
was thinking and wishing, he saw something moving.
He rubbed his eyes and looked again, and
then he saw an old man, no bigger than a broomstick,
and no taller than a teacup, peeping from
behind the oven.</p>
<div id='i124'  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/i124.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>HE SAW AN OLD MAN, NO BIGGER THAN A BROOMSTICK</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“‘Are they all gone?’ he whispered, coming
forward a little way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘All who?’ asked Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The old ones—the big man and the fat
woman.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘They have gone to bed,’ said Sparkle Spry.
‘I can call them!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No, no,’ cried the old man. ‘They are such
fools! They don’t know what is good for them.
I have been waiting for years to get a chance to
show them how to bake bread. Once I showed
myself to the man, and he thought I was a snake;
once to the woman, and she thought I was a rat.
What fools they are!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Who are you?’ inquired Sparkle Spry. He
didn’t like to hear his friends abused.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Who—me? I’m the King of the Clinkers—twice
plunged in the water and twice burned
in the fire.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, to-night you can bake all the bread
you want to,’ said Sparkle Spry. ‘The baker and
his wife have been trying to supply the army that
is camped here, but their oven is too small. They
have worked until they can work no longer, and
now they have gone to bed to rest.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Good!’ cried the King of the Clinkers.
‘Shut the door, so they can’t hear us! I’ll show
them a thing or two about baking bread.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he walked close to the hot oven, tapped
on it with a little poker that he carried in his belt,
and called out: ‘Wake up! Get out! Come
on! Hurry up! We’ve no time to lose! Show
yourselves! Stir about! Be lively!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With that, hundreds of little men swarmed
out of the ash heap behind the oven, some of
them sneezing and some rubbing their eyes, but
all jumping about with motions as quick as those
of a flea when he jumps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, please don’t talk about fleas,” pleaded
Mr. Rabbit, shuddering and scratching himself
behind the ear. “It makes the cold chills run
up my back. I never hear ’em named but I think
I can feel ’em crawling on me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyhow, that’s the way the little men jumped
about,” said Tickle-My-Toes, resuming his story.
“They swarmed in and out of the oven, hot as it
was; they swarmed in and out of the flour barrels;
they swarmed in and out of the trough where
the dough was kneaded; and they swarmed in and
out of the woodshed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The King of the Clinkers stood sometimes on
the edge of the oven, sometimes on the edge of
the flour barrels, sometimes on the edge of the
trough, sometimes on the woodpile, and sometimes
at the door of the furnace. And wherever he
stood he waved his tiny poker and told the others
what to do.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some of the little men carried wood to the
furnace, some carried flour and water to the trough,
some carried dough to the oven, and some brought
out the hot and smoking bread. Sparkle Spry
watched all this with so much surprise that he
didn’t know what to say or do. He saw the
loaves of bread rise up in rows as high as the
ceiling, and he sat and watched it as dumb as an
oyster. He had seen bread baked, but he had
never seen such baking as this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finally the eye of the King of the Clinkers
fell on Sparkle Spry. ‘Don’t sit there doing
nothing,’ he cried. ‘Go fetch wood and pile it
here by the furnace door. You can do that!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sparkle Spry did as he was bid, but though
he brought the wood as fast as he could, he found
that he couldn’t bring it fast enough. Pretty
soon the King of the Clinkers called out to him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You can rest now. The flour is all gone,
and we have hardly begun.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There’s plenty in the storehouse,’ said
Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How many barrels?’ asked the King of the
Clinkers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Two hundred,’ Sparkle Spry answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The King of the Clinkers wrung his hands in
despair. ‘Hardly a mouthful—hardly a mouthful!
It will all be gone before the chickens crow
for day. But run fetch the key. Two hundred
barrels will keep us busy while they last.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sparkle Spry brought the key of the storehouse
door, and the little men swarmed in and
rolled the barrels out in a jiffy. Only one accident
happened. In taking the flour out of one
of the barrels, after they had rolled it near the
dough trough, one of the little men fell in and
would have been drowned but for Sparkle Spry,
who felt around in the loose flour and lifted him
out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drowned!” cried Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course,” answered Tickle-My-Toes. “Why
not? I ought to have said ‘smothered,’ but now
that I’ve said ‘drowned’ I’ll stick to it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better stick to the story,” remarked Mr. Rabbit
solemnly,—“Better stick to the story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, I think he’s doing very well,” said Mrs.
Meadows in an encouraging tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Tickle-My-Toes, “the little men
worked away until they had baked the two hundred
barrels of flour into nice brown loaves of
bread. This made five hundred barrels they had
used, and that was all the baker had on hand.
The fifteen hundred pounds of flour made twenty
hundred and odd fat loaves, and these the King
of the Clinkers had carried into the storehouse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When all this was done, and nicely done, the
King of the Clinkers went to the door of the room
where the baker and his wife were sleeping. They
were snoring as peacefully as two good people
ever did. Then he went to the street door and
listened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Get home—get home!’ he cried to the little
men. ‘I hear wagons rumbling on the pavement;
they will be here presently for bread.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little men scampered this way and that,
behind the oven and into the ash heap, and, in a
few seconds, all had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now,’ said the King of the Clinkers, ‘I want
to tell you that I’ve had a splendid time, and
I’m very much obliged to you for it. I have
enjoyed myself, and I want to make some returns
for it. Pretty soon the bread wagons will be at
the door clamoring for bread. You will wake the
baker and his wife. When they find all their
flour made into nice bread they will be very much
surprised. They will ask you who did it. You
must tell them the truth. They will not believe
it, but they’ll be very proud of you. They will
be willing to give you anything you want. Tell
them you want a wooden horse. They will have
it built for you. It must have a window on each
side and good strong hinges in the legs. Good-by!
I hear the wagons at the door.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The King of the Clinkers waved his hand
and disappeared behind the oven. The wagons
rattled near the door, the teamsters cracking their
whips and calling for bread for the hungry army.
Sparkle Spry ran to the baker and shook him, and
ran to the baker’s wife and shook her. They
were soon awake, but when the baker learned that
the wagons had come for bread, he threw up both
hands in despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m ruined!’ he cried. ‘I ought to have
been baking and here I’ve been sleeping! And
the army marches away to-day, leaving me with
all my stock of flour on hand. Oh, why didn’t
the boy wake me?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Come,’ said his wife; ‘we’ll sell what we’ve
got, and not cry over the rest.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“They went into the storehouse, and there they
saw a sight such as they had never seen before.
The room was so full of steaming bread that they
could hardly squeeze in at the door. From floor
to ceiling it was stacked and packed. They sold
and sold until every loaf was gone, and then, instead
of the bread, the baker and his wife had a
sack full of silver money.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The baker went in to count it, but his wife
took it away from him. ‘Not now,’ she said;
‘not until we have thanked this boy.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You are right!’ cried the baker. ‘It’s the
most wonderful thing I ever heard of. How did
you manage it?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Some little men helped me,’ answered Sparkle
Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The woman seized his hands and kissed his
fingers. ‘These are the little men,’ she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There’s one thing I’m sorry for,’ said
Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What is that?’ asked the baker.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, we had to burn so much wood.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t mention it—don’t mention it,’ protested
the baker.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now,’ said the baker’s wife, embracing Sparkle
Spry again, ‘you deserve something for making
us rich. What shall it be?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The baker frowned a little at this, but his
brow cleared when Sparkle Spry replied that he
wanted a wooden horse built.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You shall have it,’ said the baker’s wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes, indeed,’ assented the baker. ‘As fine
a one as you want.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>XII.<br /> <br />THE TERRIBLE HORSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>When Tickle-My-Toes had told about how
pleased the baker and his wife were with Sparkle
Spry, he paused and looked at Chickamy Crany
Crow, as if he expected that she would beckon
him away. But, instead of that, she said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, that isn’t all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s enough, I hope,” replied Tickle-My-Toes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Mrs. Meadows, “it’s not enough,
if there’s any more. Why, so far it’s the best
of all the stories. It’s new to me. I had an idea
that I had heard all the stories, but this one is a
pole over my persimmon, as we used to say in the
country next door.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t like to tell stories,” protested Tickle-My-Toes,
puckering his face in a comical way.
“It’s too confining.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit. “It’s
time you were settling down. What will you look
like a year or two from now, if you keep on cutting
up your capers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tickle-My-Toes caught hold of the corner of
Chickamy Crany Crow’s apron, and, thus fortified,
resumed his story:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the baker and his wife promised Sparkle
Spry they would have him a big wooden horse
made, and they were as good as their word. They
sent right off that very day for a carpenter and
joiner, and when he came, Sparkle Spry showed
the man what he wanted. He said the horse must
be as much like a real horse as could be made out
of wood, and three times as big.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man asked the baker’s wife what the brat
wanted with such a machine as that, and this made
the good woman mad.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘He’s no brat, I can tell you that!’ she exclaimed,
‘and if he wants a play horse as big as a
whale and the same shape, he shall have it. Now
if you want to make his play horse, get to work
and make it. If not, I’ll get somebody else to
make it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the man declared he meant no harm, and
said he was glad to get the work. So he got the
lumber, and in a few days, being a very clever
workman, he had finished the wooden horse. He
made it just as Sparkle Spry wanted him to. He
put big hinges at the joints of the legs, cut a window
in each side of the body, made the ears and
the nostrils hollow, and fixed pieces of glass for
the eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The carpenter seemed to enjoy his work, too,
for every time he went off a little distance to see
how his work looked, he laughed as hard as he
could. When he was nearly done he asked Sparkle
Spry if he wanted the roof shingled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, no,’ replied the boy. ‘There’s no
roof there. Besides, horses don’t have shingles
on them.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’ll look pretty rough,” remarked the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes,’ said Sparkle Spry, ‘but after you get
through with him he is to be polished off.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That’s so,’ the carpenter assented, ‘but this
horse has a good many things about him that
other horses haven’t got.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, when the carpenter was through with the
horse, a leather finisher was sent for, and he covered
the horse with hides of cows tanned with the
hair on, and fixed a cow’s tail where the horse’s
tail should have been.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The baker grumbled a little at this extra expense,
and said he was afraid Sparkle Spry had
strained his head the night he baked so much
bread. But the baker’s wife said she would like
to have a whole house full of crazy children, if
Sparkle Spry was crazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the wooden horse was finished, Sparkle
Spry waited until the baker and his wife had gone
to bed, and then he tapped on the oven and whistled.
Presently the King of the Clinkers peeped
out to see what the matter was. He came from
behind the oven cautiously, until he found that
Sparkle Spry was alone, and then he came forth
boldly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The horse is ready,’ said Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Ready!’ exclaimed the King of the Clinkers.
‘Well, I think it is high time. My workmen
could have built it in a night; and here I
have been waiting and waiting for I don’t know
how long.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I hope you’ll like it,’ Sparkle Spry suggested.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Like it!’ cried the King of the Clinkers.
‘Why, of course I’ll like it. I haven’t enjoyed
a ride in so long that I’m not likely to quarrel
with the horse that carries me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But this is a wooden horse,’ remarked Sparkle
Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I should hope so; yes, indeed!’ grunted
the King of the Clinkers. ‘I have been riding
wooden horses as long as I can remember. They
may be a little clumsy, but they suit me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But this horse has no rockers,’ persisted
Sparkle Spry. ‘It is as solid as a house.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Much you know about wooden horses,’ said
the King of the Clinkers. ‘Wait; I’ll call my
torchbearers.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“He tapped on the oven with his tiny poker,
and immediately a company of little men filed out
from behind it. As they passed the furnace door
they lit their torches at a live coal, and marched
out to the wooden horse, followed by the King of
the Clinkers and Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The latter had reason to be very much astonished
at what he saw then and afterwards. The
torchbearers led the way to the left foreleg of
the wooden horse, opened a door, and filed up a
spiral stairway, the King of the Clinkers following
after. Sparkle Spry climbed up by means of
a stepladder that the carpenter had used. When
he crawled through the window in the side of the
wooden horse, he saw that a great transformation
had taken place, and the sight of it almost took
his breath away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A furnace with a small bake oven had been
fitted up, and there was also a supply of flour, coal,
and wood. The flue from the furnace ran in the
inside of the horse’s neck, finding a vent for the
smoke at the ears. On all sides were to be seen
the tools and furniture of a bakery, and there
were places where the little men might stow themselves
away when they were not on duty, and
there was a special apartment for the King of the
Clinkers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a little while the whole interior of the
horse swarmed with the followers of the King of
the Clinkers, who stood counting them as they
came in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘All here,’ he said, waving his little poker.
‘Now get to bed and rest yourselves.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“They complied so promptly that they seemed
to disappear as if by magic. The torchbearers
had thrown their torches in the furnace, and as
wood had already been placed there, a fire was
soon kindled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now,’ said the King of the Clinkers, closing
the draught, ‘we’ll let it warm up a little and see
if the carpenter has done his work well.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thereupon he pulled a cord that seemed to
be tied to a bell, and, in a little while, Sparkle
Spry felt that the horse was in motion. He
hardly knew what to make of it. He went to
the window and peeped out, and the lights in the
houses seemed to be all going to the rear. Occasionally
a creaking sound was heard, and sometimes
he could feel a jar or jolt in the horse’s
frame.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Are we flying?’ he asked, turning to the
King of the Clinkers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Flying! Nothing of the sort. Don’t you
feel a jolt when the horse lifts up a foot and puts
it down again? I’m mighty glad it is a pacing
horse. If it was a trotting horse it would shake
us all to pieces.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where are we going?’ inquired Sparkle
Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Following the army—following the army,’
replied the King of the Clinkers. ‘There’s going
to be a big battle not far from here, and we
may take a hand in it. The king of the country
is a fat old rascal, and isn’t very well thought of
by the rest of the kings, who are his cousins; but
I live here, and he has never bothered me. Consequently,
I don’t mind helping him out in a
pinch.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How far do you have to go?’ asked Sparkle
Spry, who had no great relish for war if it was as
hard as he had heard it was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, a good many miles,’ replied the King of
the Clinkers, ‘and we are not getting on at all.
There’s not enough mutton suet on the knee
hinges to suit me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So saying, he struck the bell twice, and instantly
Sparkle Spry could feel that the wooden
horse was going faster.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Does the horse go by the road or through
the fields?’ asked Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, we take short cuts when necessary,’ answered
the King of the Clinkers. ‘We have no
time to go round by the road. I hope you are
not scared.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No, not scared,’ replied Sparkle Spry somewhat
doubtfully; ‘but it makes me feel queer to
be traveling through the country in a wooden
horse.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing more was said for some time, and
Sparkle Spry must have dropped off to sleep, for
suddenly he was aroused by the voice of the King
of the Clinkers, who called out:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Here we are! Get up! Stir about!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sparkle Spry jumped to his feet and looked
from the window. Day was just dawning, and
on the plain before him he saw hundreds of twinkling
lights, as if a shower of small stars had fallen
to the ground during the night. Being somewhat
dazed by his experiences, he asked what they
were.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Camp-fires,’ replied the King of the Clinkers.
‘The army that we are going to attack is
camped further away, but if you will lift your
eyes a little, you will see their camp-fires.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Do we attack them by ourselves?’ Sparkle
Spry asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Of course!’ the King of the Clinkers answered.
‘I never did like too much company;
besides, I want you to get the credit of it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now, I’d rather be certain of a whole skin
than to have any credit,’ protested Sparkle Spry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the King of the Clinkers paid no attention
to his protests. He gave his orders to his
little men, and strutted about with an air of importance
that Sparkle Spry would have thought
comical if he had not been thinking of the battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Daylight came on and drowned out the camp-fires,
leaving only thin columns of blue smoke to
mark them. The wooden horse moved nearer
and nearer to the army directly in front of them,
and finally came close to the headquarters of the
commanding general, who sent out a soldier to inquire
the meaning of the apparition. Finally the
general came himself, accompanied by his staff,
and to him Sparkle Spry repeated what the King
of the Clinkers had told him to say. The general
pulled his mustache and knitted his brows mightily,
and finally he said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m obliged to you for coming. You’ll
have to do the best you can. I never have commanded
a wooden horse, and if I were to tell you
what to do, I might get you into trouble. I’ll
just send word along the line that the wooden
horse is on our side, and you’ll have to do the
best you can.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“As he said, so he did. The army soon knew
that a big wooden horse had come to help it, and
when the queer-looking machine moved to the
front, the soldiers got out of the way as fast as
they could, and some of them forgot to carry their
arms with them. But order was soon restored,
and presently it was seen that the opposing army
was marching forward to begin the battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The King of the Clinkers waited until the
line was formed, and then he sounded the little
bell. The horse started off. The bell rang
twice, and the horse went faster. Sparkle Spry,
looking from the window, could see that he was
going at a tremendous rate. The horse went close
to the opposing army, and then turned and went
down the line to the left. Turning, it came up
the line, this time very close. Turning again, it
came back, and the soldiers in the front line were
compelled to scamper out of the way. While this
was going on, the other army came up, but by the
time it arrived on the battle-ground there was
nothing to fight.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE WOODEN HORSE HAD STAMPEDED THE ENEMY’S ARMY</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“The wooden horse had stampeded the enemy’s
army, and the soldiers had all run away, leaving
their arms, their tents, and their bread wagons to
be captured.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The commanding general of the victorious
army thanked Sparkle Spry very heartily. ‘I’ll
mention your name in my report to the king,’ he
said. ‘But I hardly know what to say about the
affair. You wouldn’t call this a battle, would
you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No,’ replied Sparkle Spry, ‘I saw no signs
of a battle where I went along.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It is very curious,’ said the general. ‘I
don’t know what we are coming to. A great
victory, but nobody killed and no prisoners
taken.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he went off to write his report, and
some time afterward the king sent for Sparkle
Spry, and gave him lands and houses and money,
and made him change his every-day name for a
high-sounding one. And the baker and his wife
came to live near him, and the King of the Clinkers
used to come at night with all his little men,
and they had a very good time after all, in spite
of the high-sounding name.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With this, Tickle-My-Toes turned and ran away
as hard as he could, whereupon Mr. Rabbit
opened his eyes and asked in the most solemn
way:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there a wooden horse after him? I wish
you’d look.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c007'>XIII.<br /> <br />HOW BROTHER LION LOST HIS WOOL.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Mr. Rabbit shaded his eyes with his hand, and
pretended to believe that there might be a wooden
horse trying to catch Tickle-My-Toes after all.
But Mrs. Meadows said that there was no danger
of anything like that. She explained that Tickle-My-Toes
was running away because he didn’t
want to hear what was said about his story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think he’s right,” remarked Mr. Rabbit.
“It was the queerest tale I ever heard in all my
life. You might sit and listen to tales from now
until—well—until the first Tuesday before the
last Saturday in the year seven hundred thousand,
seven hundred and seventy-seven, and you’d
never hear another tale like it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t see why,” suggested Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” replied Mr. Rabbit, chewing his tobacco
very slowly, “there are more reasons than
I have hairs in my head, but I’ll only give you
three. In the first place, this Sparkle Spry doesn’t
marry the king’s daughter. In the second place,
he doesn’t live happily forever after; and in the
third place”—Mr. Rabbit paused and scratched
his head—“I declare, I’ve forgotten the third
reason.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it’s no better than the other two, it doesn’t
amount to much,” said Mrs. Meadows. “There’s
no reason why he shouldn’t have married the
king’s daughter, if the king had a daughter, and
if he didn’t live happily it was his own fault.
Stories are not expected to tell everything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, I’m glad of that,” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit,
“truly glad. I’ve had a story on my mind
for many years, and I’ve kept it to myself because
I had an idea that in telling a story you had to
tell everything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you were very much mistaken,” said
Mrs. Meadows with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So it seems—so it seems,” remarked Mr.
Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the story?” asked Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I called it a story,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “but
that is too big a name for it. I reckon you have
heard of the time when Brother Lion had hair all
over him as long and as thick as the mane he now
has?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the children shook their heads. They had
never heard of that, and even Mrs. Meadows said
it was news to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, that is very queer,” remarked Mr. Rabbit,
filling his pipe slowly and deliberately. “Very
queer, indeed. Time and again I’ve had it on
the tip of my tongue to mention this matter, but
I always came to the conclusion that everybody
knew all about it. Of course it doesn’t seem reasonable
that Brother Lion went about covered
from head to foot, and to the tip of his tail, with
long, woolly hair; but, on the other hand, when
he was first seen without his long, woolly hair, he
was the laughing-stock of the whole district. I
know mighty well he was the most miserable
looking creature I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was curious, too, how it happened,” Mr.
Rabbit continued. “We were all living in a
much colder climate than that in the country next
door. Six months in the year there was ice in
the river and snow on the ground, and them that
didn’t lay up something to eat when the weather
was open had a pretty tough time of it the rest of
the year. Brother Lion’s long woolly hair belonged
to the climate. But for that, he would
have frozen to death, for he was a great hunter,
and he had to be out in all sorts of weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One season we had a tremendous spell of cold
weather, the coldest I had ever felt. I happened
to be out one day, browsing around, when I saw
blue smoke rising a little distance off, so I says to
myself, says I, I’ll go within smelling distance of
the fire and thaw myself out. I went towards
the smoke, and I soon saw that Mr. Man, who
lived not far off, had been killing hogs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, the funny thing about that hog-killing
business,” continued Mr. Rabbit, leaning back in
his chair and smacking his lips together, as old
people will do sometimes, “was that, after the
hogs were killed, Mr. Man had to get their hair
off. I don’t know how people do now, but that
was what Mr. Man did then. He had to get the
hair off—but how? Well, he piled up wood,
and in between the logs he placed rocks and
stones. Then he dug a hole in the ground and
half buried a hogshead, the open end tilted up a
little higher than the other end. This hogshead
he filled with as much water as it would hold in
that position. Then he set fire to the pile of
wood. As it burned, of course the rocks would
become heated. These Mr. Man would take in a
shovel and throw in the hogshead of water. The
hot rocks would heat the water, and in this way
the hogs were scalded so the hair on their hides
could be scraped off.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the day I’m telling you about, Mr.
Man had been killing hogs and scalding the hair
off. When I got there the pile of wood had
burned away, and Mr. Man had just taken his
hogs home in his wagon. The weather was very
cold, and as I stood there warming myself I heard
Brother Lion roaring a little way off. He had
scented the fresh meat, and I knew he would
head right for the place where the hogs had been
killed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Brother Lion had been worrying me a
good deal. He had hired Brother Wolf to capture
me, and Brother Wolf had failed. Then
he hired Brother Bear, and Brother Bear got
into deep trouble. Finally he hired Brother Fox,
and I knew the day wasn’t far off when Mrs.
Fox would have to hang crape on her door and
go in mourning. All this had happened some
time before, and I bore Brother Lion no good
will.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, when I heard him in the woods singing
out that he smelled fresh blood, I grabbed the
shovel the man had left, and threw a dozen or so
hot rocks in the hogshead, and then threw some
fresh dirt on the fire. Presently Brother Lion
came trotting up, sniffing the air, purring like
a spinning wheel a-running, and dribbling at the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I passed the time of day with him as he came
up, but kept further away from him than he could
jump. He seemed very much surprised to see
me, and said it was pretty bad weather for such
little chaps to be out; but I told him I had on
pretty thick underwear, and besides that I had
just taken a hot bath in the hogshead.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m both cold and dirty,’ says he, smelling
around the hogshead, ‘and I need a bath. I’ve
been asleep in the woods yonder, and I’m right
stiff with cold. But that water is bubbling around
in there mightily.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’ve just flung some rocks in,’ says I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How do you get in?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Back in,’ says I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Lion walked around the hogshead
once or twice, as if to satisfy himself that there
was no trap, and then he squatted and began to
crawl into the hogshead backwards. By the time
his hind leg touched the water, he pulled it out
with a howl, and tried to jump away, but, somehow,
his foot slipped off the rim of the hogshead,
and he soused into the water—kerchug!—up to
his shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit paused, shut his eyes, and chuckled
to himself.</p>
<div id='i150'  class='figcenter id016'>
<img src='images/i150.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>YOU NEVER HEARD SUCH HOWLING SINCE YOU WERE BORN</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Well, you never heard such howling since
you were born. Brother Lion scrambled out
quicker than a cat can wink her left eye, and
rolled on the ground, and scratched around, and
tore up the earth considerably. I thought at first
he was putting on and pretending; but the water
must have been mighty hot, for while Brother
Lion was scuffling around, all the wool on his
body came off up to his shoulders, and if you
were to see him to-day you’d find him just that
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And more than that—before he soused himself
in that hogshead of hot water, Brother Lion
used to strut around considerably. Being the
king of all the animals, he felt very proud, and
he used to go with his tail curled over his back.
But since that time, he sneaks around as if he was
afraid somebody would see him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s another thing. His hide hurt him
so bad for a week that every time a fly lit on him
he’d wiggle his tail. Some of the other animals,
seeing him do this, thought it was a new fashion,
and so they began to wiggle their tails. Watch
your old house cat when you go home, and you
will see her wiggle her tail forty times a day without
any reason or provocation. Why? Simply
because the other animals, when they saw Brother
Lion wiggling his tail, thought it was the fashion;
and so they all began it, and now it has become
a habit with the most of them. It is curious how
such things go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the queerest thing of all,” continued Mr.
Rabbit, leaning back in his chair, and looking at
Mrs. Meadows and the children through half-closed
eyes, “was this—that the only wool left
on Brother Lion’s body, with the exception of his
mane, was a little tuft right on the end of his
tail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How was that?” inquired Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit laughed heartily, but made no
reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t see anything to laugh at,” said Mrs.
Meadows with some emphasis. “A civil question
deserves a civil answer, I’ve always heard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you know what you said a while ago,”
remarked Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know as I remember,” replied Mrs.
Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you said pointedly that it was not
necessary to tell everything in a story.” Mr.
Rabbit made this remark with great dignity.
“And I judged by the way you said it that it was
bad taste to tell everything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I remember now,” said Mrs. Meadows,
laughing. “It was only one of my jokes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But this is no joke,” protested Mr. Rabbit,
winking at the children, but keeping the serious
side of his face toward Mrs. Meadows. “I took
you at your solemn word. Now there is a tuft of
wool on Brother Lion’s tail, and you ask me how
it happened to be there. I answer you as you
answered me—’You don’t have to tell everything
in a story.’ Am I right, or am I wrong?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll not dispute with you,” remarked Mrs.
Meadows, taking up her knitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t mind telling you,” remarked Mr. Rabbit,
turning to the children with a confidential
air. “It was as simple as falling off a log. When
Brother Lion fell into the hogshead of hot water,
the end of his tail slipped through the bunghole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This explanation was such an unexpected one
that the children laughed, and so did Mrs. Meadows.
But Mr. Thimblefinger, who had put in an
appearance, shook his head and remarked that he
was afraid that Mr. Rabbit got worse as he grew
older, instead of better.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c007'>XIV.<br /> <br />BROTHER LION HAS A SPELL OF SICKNESS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“The fact is,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, “I was
just telling the story—if you can call it a story—to
please company. If you think the end of
Brother Lion’s tale is the end of the story, well
and good; but it didn’t stop there when I told it
in my young days. And it didn’t stop there
when it happened. But maybe I’ve talked too
long and said too much. You know how we gabble
when we get old.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I like to hear you talk,” said Sweetest Susan,
edging a little closer to Mr. Rabbit and smiling
cutely.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit took off his glasses and wiped them
on his big red handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s some comfort in that,” he declared.
“If you really like to hear me talk, I’ll go right
ahead and tell the rest of the story. It’s a little
rough in spots, but you’ll know how to make
allowances for that. The creatures had claws and
tushes, and where these grow thick and long,
there’s bound to be more or less scratching and
biting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, when Brother Lion had the wool
scalded off his hide, he was in a pretty bad condition.
He managed to get home, but it was a
long time before he could come out and go roaming
around the country. As he was the king of
the animals, of course all the rest of the creatures
called on him to see how he was getting on. I
didn’t go myself, because I didn’t know how he
felt towards me. I was afraid he had heard me
laugh when he backed into the hogshead of hot
water, though I made believe I was sneezing.
Consequently, I didn’t go and ask him how he
was getting on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I went close enough to know that Brother
Fox had told Brother Lion a great rigamarole
about me. That was Brother Fox’s way. In
front of your face, he was sweeter than sauce and
softer than pudding, but behind your back—well,
he didn’t have any claws, but what tushes
he had he showed them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never did hear what Brother Fox said about
me in any one place and at any one time, but I
heard a little here and a little there, and when it
was all patched up and put together it made a
great mess. I had done this, and I had done
that; I had laughed at Brother Lion behind his
back, and I had snickered at him before his face;
I had talked about him and made fun of him;
and, besides all that, I had never had the politeness
to call on him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All the other animals found Brother Lion so
willing to listen that they learned Brother Fox’s
lies by heart, and went and recited them here and
there about the country; and in that way I got
hold of the worst of them. The trouble with
Brother Fox was that he had an old grudge
against me. He had been trying to outdo me for
many a long year, but somehow or other he always
got caught in his own trap. He had a willing
mind and a thick head, and when these get together
there’s always trouble. The willing mind
pushes and the thick head goes with its eyes shut.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In old times, people used to say that Brother
Fox was cunning, but I believe they’ve quit that
since the facts have come to light. My experience
with him is that he is blessed with about as much
sense as a half-grown guinea pig. He’s a pretty
swift runner, but he doesn’t even know when the
time comes to run.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, when Brother Fox found out that
for some reason or other I wasn’t visiting Brother
Lion, he seized the chance to talk about me, and
it wasn’t such a great while before he managed
to make Brother Lion believe that I was the worst
enemy he had and the cause of all his trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I knew pretty well that something of the sort
was going on, for every time I’d meet any of the
other animals, they’d ask me why I didn’t call
and see Brother Lion. Brother Fox, especially,
was anxious to know why I hadn’t gone to ask
after Brother Lion’s health.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I put them all off for some time, until finally
one day I heard that Brother Lion had given
Brother Fox orders to catch me and bring me before
him. This didn’t worry me at all, because I
knew that Brother Fox was just as able to catch
me as I was to catch a wild duck in the middle
of a mill-pond. But I concluded I’d go and see
Brother Lion and find out all about his health.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I went, taking good care to go galloping
by Brother Fox’s house. He was sitting on his
front porch, and I could see he was astonished,
but I neither said howdy nor turned my head. I
knew he would follow along after.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='p-158'></a>“When I got to Brother Lion’s house everything was
very quiet, but I knew Brother Lion was awake, for I heard him groan
every time he tried to turn over. So I rapped at the door and then
walked in. Brother Lion watched me from under his tousled mane for some
time before he said anything. Then he says, says he:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What’s this I hear?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘Not having your ears, I can’t say.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘My ears are as good as anybody’s ears,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But I can’t hear through them,’ says I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He grunted and grumbled a little over this,
because he didn’t know what reply to make.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You haven’t been to see me until now,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No,’ says I; ‘I knew you were pretty bad off,
and so I had no need to come and ask you how
you were. I knew I was partly to blame in the
matter, and so I went off to see if I couldn’t find
a cure for you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘Don’t talk about cures. Everybody
that has come to see me has a cure. I’ve
tried ’em all, and now I’m worse off than I was
at first.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘I could have come as often as Brother
Fox did, and my coming would have done
you just as much good.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I don’t know about that,’ says he. ‘Brother
Fox has been mighty neighborly. He has lost
sleep on my account, and he has told me a great
many things that I didn’t know before.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Likely enough,’ says I. ‘I’ve known him
to tell people a great many things that he didn’t
know himself. But Brother Fox,’ says I, ‘was
the least of all things in my mind when I found
out that you had been scalded by water that was
not more than milk-warm. I didn’t need to be
told that when milk-warm water scalds the hair
off of anybody, something else is the matter beside
the scalding.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“At this Brother Lion seemed to quiet down a
little. He didn’t talk so loud, and he began to
show the whites of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes,’ says I, ‘Brother Fox is famous for
talking behind the door, but I’ve noticed that
he never says anything nice about anybody. You
know what he’s said about me, but do you know
what he’s said about you? Of course you don’t,
and I’m not going to tell you, because I don’t
want you to be worried.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But I’d like to know,’ says Brother Lion,
says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It wouldn’t do you any good,’ says I. ‘I
could have come here and jowered and made a
good deal of trouble, but instead of that I knew
of an old friend of mine who knows how to cure
hot burns and cold burns, and so I’ve been off
on a long trip to see the witch doctor, old
Mammy-Bammy Big Money.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘And did you see her?’ says Brother Lion,
says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I most certainly did,’ says I, ‘and furthermore
I laid the whole case before her. I had to
travel far and wide to find her, but when I did
find her I asked her to tell me what was good for
a person who had been scalded by milk-warm
water. She asked me three times the name of
the person, and three times I told her. Then she
lit a pine splinter, blew it out, and watched the
smoke scatter. There was something wrong, for
she shook her head three times.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What did Mammy-Bammy Big Money say?’
says Brother Lion, says he. His voice sounded
very weak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘She said nothing,’ says I. ‘She watched
the smoke scatter, and then she put her hands before
her face and rocked from side to side. After
that she walked back and forth, and when she sat
down again she took off her left slipper, shook
out the gravel, and counted it as it fell. Once
more she asked me the name of the person who
had been scalded in milk-warm water, and once
more I told her.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Wait!’ says Brother Lion, says he. ‘Do
you mean to tell me the water I fell in was only
milk-warm?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘It seemed so to me. I had just
washed my face and hands in it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, well, well!’ says Brother Lion. ‘What
else did she say?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I don’t like to tell you,’ says I; and just
about that time Brother Fox walked in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But you must tell me,’ says Brother Lion,
says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says I, ‘if I must I will, but I don’t
like to. When Mammy-Bammy Big Money had
counted the white pebbles that fell from her slipper,
and asked me the name of the person who
was scalded in milk-warm water, she told me that
he could be cured by poulticing the burns with
the fresh hide of his best friend. I asked her the
name of this friend, but she shook her head and
said she would call no names. Then she said that
your best friend had short ears, a sharp nose, keen
eyes, slim legs, and a bushy tail.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Lion shut his eyes and pretended to
be thinking. I looked at Brother Fox as solemnly
as I knew how, and shook my head slowly.
Brother Fox got mighty restless. He got up and
walked around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, well, well!’ says Brother Lion, says
he. ‘That might mean Brother Wolf, or it
might mean Brother Fox.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I expect it means Brother Wolf,’ says Brother
Fox.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, you don’t mean to stand up here and
say right before Brother Lion’s face and eyes that
Brother Wolf is a better friend to him than you
are!’ says I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Fox’s mouth fell open and his tongue
hung out, and just about that time I made my
best bow, and put out for home.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But did Brother Lion try the remedy?” Buster
John inquired, as Mr. Rabbit paused and
began to light his pipe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think Brother Lion caught him and skinned
him. It’s a great pity if he didn’t. But I’ll
not be certain. So many things have happened
since then that I disremember about the hide
business. But you may be sure Brother Lion
was very superstitious. My best opinion is that
he tried the cure.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>XV.<br /> <br />A MOUNTAIN OF GOLD.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“That is a funny name for a witch,” said Buster
John, as Rabbit paused and began to nod.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which name was that?” inquired Mr.
Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Mammy-Bammy Big Money,” replied
Buster John, elevating his voice a little.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s very simple,” remarked Mr.
Thimblefinger. “‘Mammy-Bammy’ was to catch
the ear of the animals, and ‘Big Money’ was to
attract the attention of the people.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dat’s so,” said Drusilla. “Kaze time you say
‘money’ folks’ll stop der work an’ lissen at you;
an’ ef you say ‘Big Money’ dey’ll ax you ter say
it agin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s very curious about money,” continued
Mr. Thimblefinger. “I don’t know whether you
ever thought about it much—and I hope you
haven’t—but it has pestered me a good deal,
this thing you call money.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s mighty bothersome,” assented Mrs. Meadows,
“when you are where people use it, and
when you have none except what you can beg or
borrow. Thank goodness! I’m free from all
bother now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, “I don’t see
that people have much the advantage of the animals
when it comes to using money. I’ve seen
grown people work night and day for a few pieces
of metal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, of course!” cried Buster John. “They
can take the pieces of metal and buy bread and
meat to eat and clothes to wear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So much the more wonderful!” remarked Mr.
Thimblefinger. “What do the people who have
more bread and meat and clothes than they can
use want with the pieces of metal?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they may buy something else that they
haven’t got,” said Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mr. Thimblefinger shook his head. He
was not satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It puts me in mind of a tale I heard once
about a poor man who was the richest person in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But that couldn’t be, you know,” protested
Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyhow, that’s the way it seemed to me in
the story,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger. “But the
story is so old-fashioned it would hardly pass muster
now. Besides, they tell me that, as there’s not
enough metal to go round, people have begun to
make up their minds that pieces of paper with
pictures on them are just as good as the metal,
and perhaps better. It’s mighty funny to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the story?” asked Sweetest Susan.
“Please tell us about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, yes,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, “tell us
about it. If calamus root passes current with
some of my acquaintances and catnip with others,
I see no reason why people shouldn’t play make-believe
among themselves, and say that pieces of
metal and pieces of paper are worth something.
In this business people have a great advantage
over us. They can put figures on their pieces of
metal and paper and make them worth anything,
but with us a joint of calamus root is worth just
so much. It has been worth that since the year
one, and it will be worth that right on to the end
of things. Just so with a twist of catnip. But tell
us the story—tell us the story. I may drop off
to sleep, but if I do, that will be no sign that the
tale isn’t interesting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, “once upon
a time there was a country in which money became
very scarce. The people had a great deal,
but they hid it in their stockings and in the chinks
of the chimneys and in their teapots. The reason
of this was that other countries close at hand
made their money out of the same kind of metal,
and they’d bring their goods in and sell them
and carry the money off home with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course this helped to make money scarce,
and the scarcer it was the more the people clung
to it, and this made it still scarcer. Naturally
everybody kept an eye out in the hope of finding
a supply of this metal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What sort of metal was it?” asked Buster
John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gold,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” exclaimed Buster John, in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” continued Mr. Thimblefinger, “nothing
in the world but gold. Those who had money
held on to it as long as they could, because they
didn’t know how much scarcer it would be, and
those who didn’t have any were willing to sell
whatever they had for any price in order to get
some.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was lots worse than playing dolls—lots
worse. When children play make-believe with
dolls, they soon forget about it; but when grown
people begin to play make-believe with money,
they never get over it. The wisest men get their
heads turned when they begin to think and talk
about money. They have forgotten that it was
all a make-believe in the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here Mr. Rabbit yawned and said: “You’ll
have to excuse me if I nod a little here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” remarked Mrs. Meadows, “I feel a
little sleepy myself, but I’ll try to keep awake for
the sake of appearances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t mind me,” said Mr. Thimblefinger,
with mock politeness. “Go to sleep if you want
to, you two. I won’t have to talk so loud.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, in this country I was telling you about,
there was a young man who had saved some
money by working hard, but he didn’t save it
fast enough to suit himself. He thought so much
about it that he would stop in the middle of his
work, and sit and study about it an hour at a
time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He thought about it so much that he began
to dream about it, and one night he dreamed that
he got in a boat and went to an island on which
there was a mountain of gold that shone and
glistened in the sun. He was very unhappy
when he woke in the morning and found it was
nothing but a dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He didn’t go to work that day, but wandered
about doing nothing. That night he had the
same dream. He had the same dream the next
night; and the morning after, the first person he
saw was an old man who had stopped to rest on
the doorsteps. This old man would have been
like other old men but for one thing. His beard
was so long that he had to part it in the middle
of his chin, pass it under each arm, cross the
wisps on his back, and bring them around in front
again, where the two ends were tied together with
a bow of red ribbon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How are you, my young friend, and how
goes it?’ said the old man, smiling pleasantly.
‘You look as if you had been having wonderful
dreams.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘So I have, gran’sir,’ replied the young
man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, a dream isn’t worth a snap of your
finger unless it comes true, and a dream never
comes true until you have dreamed it three
times.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I have dreamed mine three times, gran’sir,
and yet it is impossible that it should come true.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Nonsense! Nothing is impossible. Tell me
your dream.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the young man told the old man his
dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The Island of the Mountain of Gold!’ exclaimed
the old man. ‘Why, that is right in my
line of travel. I can land you there without any
trouble. It is a little out of my way, but not
much.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How shall we get there?’ the young man
asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘On the other side of the town, I have a
boat,’ replied the old man. ‘You are welcome to
go with me. It is so seldom that dreams come
true that I shall be glad to help this one along as
well as I can. Besides, I have long wanted an
excuse to visit the Island of the Mountain of
Gold. I have passed within sight of it hundreds
of times, but have always been too busy to land
there.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The young man looked at the old man with
astonishment. If he had spoken his thoughts he
would have declared the old man to be crazy, but
he said nothing. He simply followed after him.
The old man led the way across the town to a
wharf, where his boat was tied. It was a light
little skiff that could be sailed by one man. In
this the two embarked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old man managed the sail with one hand
and the rudder with the other, and he had hardly
made things ready and taken his seat before a
light breeze sprang up and filled the sail. The
skiff glided along the water so easily that the
shore seemed to be receding while the boat stood
still. But the breeze grew stronger and stronger,
and the sail bore so heavily on the nose of the
boat that the foam and spray flew high in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The sun was bright and the sky was blue,
and the dark green water seemed to boil beneath
them, so swiftly the light boat sped along. The
young man clapped his hands as joyously as a
boy, and the old man smiled. Presently he
leaned over the side of the boat and pointed to
something shining and sparkling in the distance.
The young man saw it, too, and turned an inquiring
eye upon his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is your mountain of gold,’ said the old
man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It seems to be very small,’ said the other.
He ceased to smile, and a frown clouded his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old man noticed the frown, and shook
his head and frowned a little himself, coughing in
the muffler that was tied around his neck. But
he said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The mountain of gold is more than twenty
miles away.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How far have we come?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Some hundred and odd miles.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The young man seemed to be very much surprised,
but he said nothing. He leaned so far
over the side of the boat to watch the mountain
of gold that he was in danger of falling out.
The old man kept an eye on him, but did not lift
a finger to warn him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In due time they came to the island, if it
could be called an island. It seemed to be a barren
rock that had lifted itself out of the sea to
show the mountain of gold. The mountain was
only a hill, but it was a pretty high one, considering
it was of solid gold.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure enough gold?” asked Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pure gold,” answered Mr. Thimblefinger.
“The old man landed his skiff at a convenient
place, and the two got out and went to the mountain,
or hill, of gold that rose shining in the
middle of the small island. The actions of the
young man showed that he considered himself
the proprietor of both island and mountain. He
broke off a chunk of gold as big as your fist,
weighed it in his hand, and would have given it
to the old man, but the latter shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You refuse it?’ cried the other. ‘If it is
not enough I’ll give you as much more.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No,’ replied the old man. ‘Keep it for yourself.
You owe me nothing. I could have carried
away tons of the stuff long before I saw you, but
I had no use for it. You are welcome to as much
as you can take away with you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘As much as I can take away!’ exclaimed
the other. ‘I shall take it all.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But how?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It is mine! I am rich. I will buy me a
ship.’ He walked back and forth, rubbing his
hands together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Then you have no further need of me?’
said the old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not now—not now,’ replied the other with
a grand air. ‘You won’t accept pay for your
services, and I can do no more than thank you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old man bowed politely, got in his skiff,
and sailed away. The other continued to walk
about the island and rub his hands together, and
make his plans. He was now the richest man in
the world. He could buy kings and princes and
empires. He had enough gold to buy all the
ships on the sea and to control all the trade on
the land. He was great. He was powerful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All these thoughts passed through his mind
and he was very happy. The sun looked at the
young man a long time, and then went to bed in
the sea. Two little gray lizards looked at him
until the sun went down, and then they crawled
back in their holes. A big black bird sailed
round and round and watched him until nearly
dark, and then sailed away.</p>
<div id='i174'  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/i174.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>HE WAS SO WEAK THAT HE COULDN’T GET UP</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“When night came the young man found the
air damp and chilly, but he knew he was rich, and
so he laughed at the cold. He crept close under
his mountain of gold, and, after a long time, went
to sleep. In the morning he awoke and found
that nobody had taken away his precious mountain
of gold during the night. The sun rose to
keep him company, the two gray lizards crept out
of their holes and looked at him, and the big
black bird sailed round and round overhead.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The day passed, and then another and another.
The young man was hungry and thirsty,
but he was rich. The night winds chilled him,
but he was rich. The midday sun scorched him,
but he was the richest man in the world. Every
night, no matter how hungry or weak he was, he
crept upon the side of the mountain, and stretched
himself out, and tried to hug it to his bosom.
He knew that if he was hungry, it wasn’t because
he was poor, and if he died, he knew he
would die rich. So there he was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What then?” asked Buster John, as Mr.
Thimblefinger paused to look at his watch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll tell you,” continued Mr. Thimblefinger,
holding the watch to his ear. “One fine
morning this rich young man was so weak that
he couldn’t get up. He tried to, but his foot
slipped, and he rolled to the foot of the mountain
of gold and lay there. He lay there so long and
so quietly that the two gray lizards crept close to
him to see what was the matter. He moved one
of his fingers, and they darted back to their
holes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The rich young man lay so still that the big
black bird, sailing overhead, came nearer and
nearer, and finally alighted at a respectful distance
from the rich young man. The two gray
lizards came out again, and crawled cautiously toward
the rich young man. The big black bird
craned his neck and looked, and then went a
little closer. A sudden gust of wind caused the
rich young man’s coat to flap. The gray lizards
scrambled towards their holes, and the big black
bird jumped up in the air and flew off a little
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But presently they all came back, bird and
lizards, and this time they went still closer to the
rich young man. The big black bird went so
close that there is no telling what he would have
done next, but just then the old man came running
towards them. He had untied the two ends
of his beard, and was waving them in the air as if
they were flags. The big black bird flew away
very angry, and the gray lizards ran over each
other trying to get to their holes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old man, tied up his beard again, took up
the rich young man on his shoulder, and carried
him to the boat. Once there he gave the rich
young man some wine. This revived him, and in
a little while he was able to eat. But he had no
opportunity to talk. The wind whirled the boat
through the water, and in a few hours it had
arrived at the young man’s town.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He went home, and soon recovered in more
ways than one. He found his strength again,
and lost his appetite for riches. But he worked
hard, saved all he could, and was soon prosperous;
but he never remembered without a shiver the
time that he was the richest man in the world.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c007'>XVI.<br /> <br />AN OLD-FASHIONED FUSS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I don’t blame ’im fer shiverin’,” said Drusilla;
“but, I let you know, here’s what wouldn’t
shiver none ef she had dat ar big pile er gol’
what de man had. I’d ’a’ cotch me some fish;
I’d ’a’ gobbled up dem lizards, yit!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, “I expect
money is a pretty big thing. I’ve heard a heap
of talk about it, and I’ve known some big fusses
to grow out of it. And yet money doesn’t cause
all the fusses—oh, no! not by a long jump. I
once heard of a fuss that happened long before
there was any money, and the curious part about
it was that nobody knew what the fuss grew out
of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What fuss was that?” asked Buster John,
who thought that perhaps there might be a story
in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it was the quarrel between the Monkeys
and the Dogs. My great-grandfather knew all
about the facts, and I’ve heard him talk it over
many a time when he was sitting in the kitchen
corner chewing his quid. I’ve often heard him
wonder, between naps, what caused the dispute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It seems to me I’ve heard something about
it,” remarked Mrs. Meadows in an encouraging
tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit. “It was
notorious in our young days. I reckon it has
been settled long before this; anyhow, I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did your great-grandfather say about
it?” inquired Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I were to tell you all he said,” responded
Mr. Rabbit, shaking his head slowly, “you’d
have to sit here with me for a fortnight, and of
course you wouldn’t like to do that. So I’ll
just up and tell you about it in my own way. I
may not get it exactly right, but I’ll be bound
I won’t get it far wrong, for I have nothing else
in the round world to do but to sit here and think
about old times.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As well as I can remember, the way of it
was about this: Away back yonder, in the times
before everybody had got to be so busy trying to
get the best of each other, a coolness sprang up
between the Monkeys and the Dogs. Nobody
knew the right of it, because nobody paid any
attention to it along at first. But after awhile
it got so that every time a Dog would meet a
Monkey in the road, the Monkey would get up in
a tree and laugh at him, and then the Dog would
stop and scratch up the dirt with all four of his
feet and growl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I’ve seen them do that way,” said
Sweetest Susan, laughing.</p>
<div id='i180'  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i180.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MONKEYS WOULD MAKE FACES AND SQUEAL AT THE DOGS</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Yes,” replied Mr. Rabbit, with a more solemn
air than ever. “They have never got out of the
habit of that kind of caper from that day to this.
Well, the coolness grew into a dispute, and the
dispute into a quarrel, and so there it was. The
Monkeys would make faces and squeal at the
Dogs, and the Dogs would show their teeth and
growl at the Monkeys. It went from bad to
worse, and after awhile, the Dogs would chase
the Monkeys wherever they saw them, and the
Monkeys would swing down from the hanging
limbs and give the tails of the Dogs some terrible
twists.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before that time the Monkeys had been living
on the ground just like everybody else lived,
but the Dogs had such sharp teeth and such
nimble feet that the Monkeys had to take to the
trees and saplings. At first they couldn’t get
about in the trees as they do now. Sometimes
they’d miss their footing, or lose their grip, and
down they’d come right into the red jaws of the
Dogs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now this wasn’t pleasant at all. Even when
the Monkeys didn’t fall, the ants and crawling
bugs would get on them, and the dead limbs of
the trees would fall and hurt them, and the wind
would blow them about, and the heavy rains
would fall and wet them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that time the Monkeys were the most
miserable creatures in the world. They were so
miserable that, finally, the Head Monkey made
up his mind to go and see the Wise Man who
used to settle all disputes as far as he could. So
the Head Monkey set out on his journey, and
traveled till he came to the Wise Man’s house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He got on the gatepost, and looked all around,
to see if there was a Dog anywhere in sight.
Seeing none, he went to the front door and
knocked. The Wise Man came out. He was
very old. He had a beard as long as Brother
Billy Goat’s, and as gray, but he was very nice
and kind. The Head Monkey told his story all
the way through, and the Wise Man sat and
listened to every word. When he had heard it
all, he shut his eyes and studied the matter over,
and then he said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Only fools get up fusses that they can’t
settle. I’ll give you a fool’s remedy to settle a
fool’s fuss. Go back to your own country and
fetch me a bunch of the hair of a Brindle Dog.
Then I’ll show you a cheap and an easy way to
get rid of the whole tribe of Dogs. But be sure
that you make no mistake. I must have the hair
of a Brindle Dog—just that and nothing else.
Then I can show you how to get rid of all the
Dogs. But if you make any mistake, you will
ruin the whole tribe of Monkeys.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Head Monkey scratched himself on the
side, quick like. Says he, ‘Oh, I’ll make no
mistake. Don’t worry about me. The first time
the Dogs have a burying I’ll get on a swinging
limb, and when a Brindle Dog comes along I’ll
reach down and pull a bunch of hair out of his
hide, and by the time he gets through howling
I’ll be on my journey back.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Wise Man ran his fingers through his
beard, and laughed to himself. Says he, ‘Very
well, my young friend, but you had best be careful.
A Dog of any kind will bear watching, but
especially a Brindle Dog.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Head Monkey made no answer. He
simply grinned, and started back home. Now, it
happened that after his journey was over, the
Dogs had no burying for a long time. They
seemed to be in better health than ever. Some
traveling doctor had come along and told them
that whenever they felt out of sorts they must go
out in the fields and hunt for a particular kind of
grass. When they found it they were to eat
twenty-seven blades of it, and then go on about
their business. You may not believe this,” said
Mr. Rabbit, pausing in the midst of his story,
“but if you will watch the Dogs right close, you
will find that to this day they’ll go out and eat
grass whenever they are ailing. They don’t
chew it. They just bite off a great long sprig
of it, and wallop it around their tongues and
swallow it whole. I don’t know how they do it,
but I’m telling you the plain facts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, as I was saying, it was a long time
after the Head Monkey got home before the
Dogs had a burying, and when they did have one
it happened that there was no Brindle Dog in the
procession. The rest of the Monkeys were all
waiting to see what the Head Monkey was going
to do, and so they forgot to bother the Dogs.
When the Dogs saw that the Monkeys were quiet,
they kept quiet themselves, and there was no
trouble between them for a long time. Seeing
that the Dogs were no longer snapping and snarling
at them, some of the older Monkeys began
to travel on the ground again, but the younger
ones stayed in the trees where they were born.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Head Monkey was mighty restless.
Sometimes he’d stay in the trees, and then again
he’d travel on the ground, but wherever he was
he always kept his eye out for a Brindle Dog.
Finally, one day, when he was traveling on the
ground, he heard a noise up the road, and when
he turned around he saw a big Brindle Dog coming
towards him. He thought to himself that
now was his time or never; so he got behind a
bush and waited for the Brindle Dog to come up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He didn’t have long to wait, for the Brindle
Dog was going in a swinging trot. When he
came by the bush, the Head Monkey rushed out
and tried to pull a bunch of hair from the
Brindle Dog’s hide. But he rushed too far.
The Brindle Dog shied, as old Mr. Horse used to
do when he saw a bunch of shucks in the road.
He shied so quick, and he shied so far, that the
Head Monkey fell short with his arm, and was
carried too far by his legs. As the Brindle Dog
shied, he turned and saw what it was, and then
he made a rush for the Head Monkey. There
was no tree near, and no way for the Head Monkey
to escape. The Brindle Dog grabbed him
and made short work of him. There was considerable
of a fight, for the Head Monkey was
strong in his arms and quick on his feet. But
the Brindle Dog had a long jaw and a strong
one. He grabbed the Head Monkey between
shoulder and ham, and shook him up as you have
seen people shake a sifter. He just held on and
shook, and when he turned loose he’d shut his
teeth down in a new place, so that when the rippit
was over, it seemed as if there wasn’t a whole
bone in the Head Monkey’s hide. But quick
done is quick over: and after the Brindle Dog
had done all the shaking that the case called for,
he dropped the Head Monkey and went on about
his business; but he had some bites and scratches
on his hide, and as he trotted off he shook his
ears, for one of them had been split mighty nigh
in two by the Head Monkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, after the Brindle Dog had trotted off,
the Head Monkey rose from the ground and began
to feel of himself. He was afraid that he
had been torn in two and scattered all over the
road, but when he found that he had his legs
and his arms and his head and his body, he began
to be more cheerful. He found he could walk.
And then he found he could use his hands, and
then he strutted around, and said to himself that
he had whipped the fight. He was badly bruised
and pretty sore, but he was not too sore to strut,
and so he walked up and down the road and
made his brags that he had compelled the Brindle
Dog to take to his heels.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he happened to think what he had
come for, and he hunted all about in the road to
see if he could find a bunch of the Brindle
Dog’s hair. There was a good deal of hair scattered
around, and in a little while the Head
Monkey had gathered up a handful. He picked
it over and sorted it out, and wrapped it up in a
poplar leaf. Then he went home to his family
and rested a day or two, for he was pretty badly
bruised. And he told a big tale of how he had
met the great Brindle Dog in the road, and had
fanned him out in a fair fight. His children
listened with all their ears, and then they jumped
from limb to limb and told all the neighbors’
children that their pa was the biggest and the
best of all the Monkeys.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This went on for some time, and finally the
Head Monkey felt well enough to visit the Wise
Man. So he started on the journey, and after
awhile he got there. He climbed the gatepost
again, and looked all around to see if there was a
Brindle Dog in sight. Seeing none, he went to
the door and knocked, and the Wise Man came
out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Good-morning,’ says the Wise Man. ‘I
hope you are well.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Tolerably well, I thank you,’ says the Head
Monkey. ‘And I’ve come agreeable to promise
to bring you a bunch of the hair of a Brindle
Dog.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With that he unrolled the poplar leaf, and
showed the Wise Man the hair he had picked up
in the road. The Wise Man took the bunch of
hair and turned it over in his hand, and looked
at it. Then he looked at the Head Monkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What is this?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘A bunch of hair from a Brindle Dog,’ says
the Head Monkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Wise Man shook his head. Says he, ‘It
may be, but it doesn’t look like the samples I
have seen. Are you sure about it?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘As sure as I am standing here,’ says the Head
Monkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says the Wise Man, ‘It’s none of my business.
I just wanted to be certain about it, because
if there’s any Monkey hair in it, everything
will go wrong. The whole tribe of Monkeys will
be ruined. They will have to leave this country
and the Dogs will stay here. Did you have any
trouble in getting this hair?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the Head Monkey, ‘there was a
dispute, nothing serious.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How long did the dispute last?’ says the
Wise Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No longer than I could reach out and get
the hair,’ says the Head Monkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That’s funny,’ says the Wise Man. ‘When
the Brindle Dog gets into a dispute, he usually
shows his teeth.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, he showed his teeth, and he had more
than I thought,’ says the Head Monkey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But are you sure this hair came out of the
hide of a Brindle Dog?’ says the Wise Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says the Head Monkey, ‘As sure as I’m
standing here. I pulled it out with my own
hands.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says the Wise Man, ‘It looks to me as if
there were some other kind of hair in this bunch.
Did you have any trouble in getting it?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the Head Monkey, ‘we had a
little dispute.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says the Wise Man, ‘Was that all?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the Head Monkey, scratching
himself, ‘we passed a few licks.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How was that?’ says the Wise Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the Head Monkey, ‘he growled
and I squealed, and then he bit and I scratched.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I see,’ says the Wise Man. ‘What else?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, to tell you the truth,’ says the Head
Monkey, ‘there was right smart of a scuffle.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Aha!’ says the Wise Man. ‘A scuffle!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes,’ says the Head Monkey, ‘and worse
than that. There was a regular knock-down-and-drag-out
fight,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I see,’ says the Wise Man. ‘You have
brought me some of your own hair instead of
the Brindle Dog’s hair, and now you and your
whole tribe will have to leave this country and
cross the ocean; and when you get into the new
country, you will have to live in the trees to keep
the four-footed animals from destroying you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And so it happened,” continued Mr. Rabbit.
“Since that time, there have been no Monkeys in
this country. They had to cross the big water,
and when they got over there they had to live in
the trees; and I expect they are living that way
yet—at least, they were at last accounts.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c007'>XVII.<br /> <br />THE RABBIT AND THE MOON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I reckon that’s so about the Monkeys,” remarked
Mrs. Meadows. “They used to be in the
country next door, and now they are no longer
there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mr. Rabbit; “it’s just like I tell
you: they were there once, but now they are not
there any more. But in the world next door
everybody has his ups and downs, especially his
downs. I’ve heard my great-grandfather tell
many a time how our family used to live close to
the Moon. So I don’t make any brags about the
way the Monkeys had to take to the bushes. I
remember about my own family, and then I feel
like hanging my head down and saying nothing.
It is a very funny feeling, too. When I think we
used to live close to the Moon, and that we now
live on the ground and have to crawl there like
snails, I sometimes feel like crying; and I tell
you right now if I was to begin to boo-hoo, you’d
be astonished.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Buster John and Sweetest Susan looked very
serious, but Drusilla showed a desire to laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You say you used to live close to the Moon?”
asked Buster John, with more curiosity than
usual.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, certainly,” replied Mr. Rabbit. “I
don’t say that I did, but I’m certain that my
family did. I’ve heard my great-grandfather
tell about it a hundred times. I’ve heard that it
was a better country up there than it is where
you live, even better than it is down here,—a
good deal more fun and fiddling, and not half
so much looking around for something to eat.
That is the great trouble. If we didn’t have
to scuffle around and get something to eat, we’d
be lots better off.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s mighty funny. If you let well enough
alone, you are all right; but the minute you try
to better it, everything goes wrong.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dat wuz de way wid ol’ man Adam,” remarked
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, of course,” said Mr. Rabbit, “and it
was the way with all the Rabbits and everybody
and everything else.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But how did they live up there by the
Moon?” asked Sweetest Susan. “How did they
keep from falling off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit scratched his head a little before
replying. “Well,” said he, after awhile, “they
got along just as we do down here,—heads up
and feet down. But one time, as I’ve heard my
great-grandfather say, the Moon got into a sort of
fidget, and was mighty restless for quite a while.
At last, one of our family, the oldest of all, made
bold to look over the fence and ask the Moon
what the trouble was. He noticed, too, that the
Moon had shrunk considerably, and seemed to be
in a very bad way. It could hardly hold up its
head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the Moon managed to look up when it
heard the fuss at the fence, and, in a very shaky
voice, told the oldest of all the Rabbits howdy.</p>
<div id='i184'  class='figcenter id019'>
<img src='images/i184.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“WHAT IS THE TROUBLE?” SAYS THE OLDEST RABBIT</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“‘What is the trouble?’ says the oldest Rabbit.
Says he, ‘Can I do anything to help you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m afraid not,’ says the Moon. ‘You are
not nimble enough.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Maybe I’m nimbler than you think,’ says
the oldest Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the Moon, ‘I’ll tell you what
the trouble is. I want to get a message to Mr.
Man, who lives in the world down yonder. I’ve
been shining on him at night, and I’ve caught a
bad cold by being out after dark. My health is
breaking down, and if I don’t put out my lights
for a while and take a rest, I’ll have to go
out altogether. Now, it’s like this: I’ve been
shining for Mr. Man so long that if I don’t send
him some word he’ll think something serious has
happened. I must take a rest, but I want to
send him a message, telling him that I won’t be
gone long.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the oldest Rabbit, ‘I don’t mind
going, if you’ll show me the way and tell me
what to say.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the Moon pointed out the way, and showed
him how to put his fingers in his ears and hold
his breath when he took the long jump. Then it
gave him this message:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>‘I am growing weak to gather strength:</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>I go into the shadows to gather light.’</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“The oldest Rabbit said this message over to
himself many times, and then he got ready for
the journey. Everything went well until he came
to the long jump. But he braced himself, and
shut his eyes, and put his fingers in his ears, and
held his breath. Now, the jump was a long one,
sure enough. It was so long that the oldest
Rabbit opened one eye, and then he got the notion
that he was falling instead of jumping, and
he opened both eyes so wide that they have been
that way ever since. This scared him terribly,
and by the time he landed on the world he had
forgotten what he came for. He wasn’t hurt a
bit, but he was badly scared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He sat on the ground and tried to remember,
and then he got up and walked about. Finally,
he looked up and saw the Moon winking one eye
at him. Then he thought about the message,
and he ran off to Mr. Man’s house, and knocked
at the door. Mr. Man had gone to bed, but he
got up and opened the door, and asked what was
wanted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says the oldest Rabbit, ‘I’ve just
come from the Moon with a message for you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What is it?’ says Mr. Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The Moon told me to tell you this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>I’m growing weak and have no strength:</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>I’m going off where the shadows are dark.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Mr. Man scratched his head. He couldn’t
make the message out. Then he said, ‘Take this
message back:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Seldom seen and soon forgot:</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>When a Moon dies her feet get cold.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“The oldest Rabbit bowed politely and started
back home. He came to the Jumping-Off Place,
and then he took the long jump. He was soon
at home, and went at once to the Moon’s house,
and gave the message that Mr. Man had sent.
This made the Moon very mad. It declared that
the oldest Rabbit had carried the wrong message.
Then it grabbed the shovel and struck him in the
face. This made the oldest Rabbit very mad, and
he jumped at the Moon and used his claws. The
fight was a hard one, and you can see the marks
of it to this day. All the Rabbits have their
upper lips split, and the Moon still has the marks
on its face where the oldest Rabbit clawed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The way of it was this,” continued Mr. Rabbit,
seeing that the children had hardly caught
the drift of the story: “the Moon had been
shining constantly for many years, and was growing
weak. It wanted to take a rest, and it was
afraid Mr. Man would get scared when he failed
to see it at night. Since that time the Moon has
been taking a rest about every two weeks. At
least it used to be that way. I never bother
about it now.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c007'>XVIII.<br /> <br />WHY THE BEAR IS A WRESTLER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Mr. Rabbit, after a pause,
“what about the story? Was there any moral
to it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“None at all,” replied Mrs. Meadows. “It
was just an old-time tale.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, I’m truly glad to hear you say so,”
cried Mr. Rabbit, appearing to be very much
pleased. “It’s as good as taking a nap.” He
winked gravely at Buster John, and then proceeded
to refill his pipe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought it was a pretty good story,” said
Buster John. “It turned out to be a story so
quick that it was all over with before I knew it
was a story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “I had to tell it
mighty quick. Suppose I had stopped to light
my pipe and left my own kin dangling between
the Moon and the World! I knew in reason it
would never do, and so I rattled away almost as
fast as the oldest Rabbit jumped. It was a long
story quickly told of a long journey quickly
made.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit seemed to be in better humor than
ever. He leaned back, and patted the ground
softly with one foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speaking of journeys,” he said, after awhile,
“makes me think about how Brother Bear started
out in the world. But what am I doing?” he
cried. “I don’t want to do all the talking. I
don’t have any chance to sleep unless somebody
else is telling a story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, please tell us the story,” pleaded Sweetest
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll have to,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “since I’ve
got it started. Well, one time when Brother
Bear was young, the time came for him to scratch
around and scuffle for himself. He had already
learned how to grabble for sweet potatoes, how
to tote an armful of roasting ears, and how to
shut his eyes and rob a bee-tree, and so his daddy
thought it was about time for him to go off and
earn his own living. Brother Bear said he was
more than willing, and when he came to tell his
folks good-by, his daddy gave him seven pieces
of honey-in-the-comb, saying:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘This is all I have to give you, but it’s
enough. Whoever eats this honey with you will
have to wrestle with you seven years or give you
everything he owns.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So Brother Bear put his seven pieces of
honey-in-the-comb in a bag, slung the bag over
his back, and went shuffling down the big road.
He traveled all that day, and camped out in the
woods at night. The next morning, just as he
was about to eat breakfast, he heard a rustling
in the bushes, and presently Brother Tiger came
slipping and sliding along, hunting for his breakfast.
Brother Bear howdied, and Brother Tiger
said he was only tolerable—not as peart as he
might be, and yet pearter than he had been.
Then Brother Tiger sat and watched Brother
Bear take put a piece of his honey-in-the-comb,
and the sight made his mouth water. Brother
Bear noticed this, and he says, says he:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I wish you mighty well, Brother Tiger, and
I’d like to ask you to have some of my breakfast,
for I have more than a plenty for two. But
the trouble is, that whoever eats any of this honey-in-the-comb
will have to wrestle with me seven
years or give me all his belongings.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t let that bother you,’ says Brother
Tiger, says he. ‘I’m a pretty good wrestler myself,
and I don’t mind trying my hand with you
after I’ve tasted your honey-in-the-comb.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Brother Bear hemmed and hawed, and
acted so that Brother Tiger thought he was either
afraid to wrestle or mighty stingy with his honey-in-the-comb.
He thought so, and he said so, and
this put Brother Bear on his mettle. So he says,
says he:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, Brother Tiger, come and get a piece
of my honey-in-the-comb. I’m more than glad
to give it to you, and sorry, too, because, as sure
as you eat it, you’ll be put under a spell, and
you’ll be obliged to wrestle with me seven long
years or give me all your belongings.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Tiger grinned from ear to ear. Says
he, ‘If I don’t have to wrestle before I get the
honey-in-the-comb, it will be all right. Just let
me get my fill of that, and I’ll wrestle with you
seven times seven years. I’ll promise to make
you tired of wrestling.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘So be it,’ says Brother Bear. ‘Come and
get the honey-in-the-comb, and take all you want,
for I won’t need any after I’ve wrestled with
you a time or two,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Tiger went up and tasted the honey-in-the-comb,
and it was so good that he smacked
his lips and asked for more. Brother Bear gave
him some. After both had eat as much as they
wanted, Brother Tiger took a notion to go home,
but something held him back. The spell was
working. But finally he pulled himself together,
and said he believed he’d go home and see his
old woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Brother Bear chuckled to himself. Says
he, ‘Now that you’ve gobbled up my honey-in-the-comb,
you don’t want to wrestle. You can’t
help yourself. When I say wrestle, you’ll have
to wrestle. You can go home now, but to-morrow,
bright and early, I’ll knock at your
door, and you’ll have to come out and wrestle.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Tiger, says he, ‘I’ll be more
than glad to accommodate you. Just knock at
the door any hour after daybreak, and you’ll
find me on hand.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Bear, ‘I’ll do so, I’ll do
so. Just remember your spoken word, Brother
Tiger!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Tiger started home, but before he
had gone very far he began to feel mighty queer.
He had a buzzing noise in his head and a creepy,
crawly feeling on his hide. He began to get
scared. Once he thought the honey had poisoned
him, but he wasn’t sick. He never felt better in
his life. He wanted to jump and run, and I believe
the tale does say that he capered around a
time or two. But every time he’d start home
he’d have that buzzing sound in his head and
that creepy, crawly feeling in his hide.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, by and by, he thought he would turn
back and see what Brother Bear thought about
it. No sooner said than done. He went back at
a hand gallop, and found Brother Bear curled up
at the foot of a tree fast asleep. The honey had
made him feel so good that he concluded to enjoy
himself by taking another nap. But he got up
brisk enough when he heard Brother Tiger calling
him, and by the time he had rubbed his eyes
once or twice, and gaped and stretched himself,
he was as wide awake as ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘I knew you’d come back, Brother
Tiger, and so I just waited for you; and while I
was waiting I ups and drops off to sleep. But
anyhow and anyway, here you are, and there’s no
harm done.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Tiger, says he, ‘I just came
back to ask you about the queer feeling I have.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Bear, ‘That’s easy enough.
You just wanted to wrestle, and so you had to
come back. I have the feeling most all the time
when I’m not sleeping or eating. It’s a sort of
zooning sound in the ears, and a sort of ticklish
feeling on the hide. Well, there isn’t anything
the matter at all. You just want to wrestle, and
as the feeling is new to you, you didn’t know
what it was.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Brother Tiger, ‘I believe you are right,
Brother Bear; I believe that’s the whole trouble.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says Brother Bear, ‘I’ll try you
one round, just to loosen up my hide and put me
in traveling trim. I’ll not wrestle with you very
hard, because you are not used to it, and it’s too
soon to get down to business with you. I told
you about it when you wanted to eat the honey,
but you would eat it, and now you’ll have to
wrestle with me, off and on, first and last, for
seven long years; and if you don’t, you’ll have
to give me your house and all your belongings.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they took off their coats and made ready
to wrestle. ‘As you are not used to these capers,’
says Brother Bear, ‘I’ll give you all-under holt,
and promise not to use the in-turn, the ham-twist,
or the knee-lock.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Brother Tiger didn’t know whether
Brother Bear was talking Latin or Chinese, but
he said nothing: he just stood up and grabbed
Brother Bear around the waist, or where the
waist ought to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘When you are ready,’ says Brother Bear,
‘just give the word.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says Brother Tiger, ‘I reckon I’m as
ready now as I ever will be.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With that Brother Bear hugged Brother
Tiger pretty tight, whirled around with him a
time or two, fell on him, and then cuffed him,
first on one ear and then on the other. It was
all done so quick that Brother Tiger didn’t have
time to say don’t. He got up and felt of his ribs
to see if they were still whole, and then he
rubbed the side of his head where Brother Bear
had cuffed him. It had already begun to swell.
His breeches were badly ripped, and he was sore
all over.</p>
<div id='i204'  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/i204.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>HE RUBBED THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Says he, ‘And so this is what you call wrestling—this
is what I was itching for, is it?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, no!’ says Brother Bear. ‘It wouldn’t
do to call that wrestling. That was only playing.
I was just showing you the first few capers: you
can’t wrestle until you learn how. I’ll drop by
your house to-morrow morning, bright and early,
and give you another whirl.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brother Tiger looked mighty solemn, but he
didn’t say anything. He ambled off home as
well as he could in his condition, and got his old
woman to mend his breeches. She wanted to
know who he had been fighting with, but he told
her he had just been playing with Brother Bear.
She laughed, and said that when he had played
that way a few more times there wouldn’t be
enough of him left, neither breeches, body, nor
bones, to sew up in a bag.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the next morning, bright and early,
Brother Bear rapped at Brother Tiger’s door, and
told him to come out and take some exercise before
breakfast. Brother Tiger didn’t like this
invitation at all. He said he wanted to sleep a
little longer; but Brother Bear sent in word that
the night was made for sleeping, while the day
was made for work and play. Now, it so happened
that the honey which Brother Tiger had
ate had put a spell on him, and when Brother
Bear asked him out to wrestle he had to come.
He pulled on his clothes with no good heart, for
he was still very sore, and came limping out, trying
to put a good face on the affair. Brother
Bear laughed, and told Brother Tiger howdy, but
Brother Tiger didn’t make much of a reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So Brother Bear says, says he, ‘I hope you
are not begrudging your bargain, Brother Tiger,
but you made it yourself, and at no invitation of
mine. I had the seven pieces of honey-in-the-comb,
and you had the bad taste in the mouth.
I told you how it would be, but you would have
the honey, and now you’ll have to stand to your
bargain: you can’t help yourself now. I told
you the plain truth about it, but you wouldn’t
believe it. You’ll find out the truth before you
get the taste of that honey out of your mouth.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then they made a few passes at each other;
but Brother Bear finally grabbed Brother Tiger
around his striped waist, squeezed the breath out
of him, dashed him on the ground, cuffed his
ears, and then stood there on his hind legs, waiting
to see what Brother Tiger was going to do.
But Brother Tiger didn’t want any more wrestling
for that day. He went into the house and washed
his face and hands, and sat down and licked his
bruises the best he could.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the next morning he had to come out
and wrestle again, and this happened until he was
so weak he could hardly walk. His hide was
split, his ears were swollen, and every stripe on
his long body was crossed by a scar. Wrestling
was fine fun for Brother Bear, who was used to it,
but it was no fun for Brother Tiger, who didn’t
know how. Every time he wrestled he got new
bruises, and his head swelled until he could hardly
get in the door of his house without backing
his ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finally, one day he told Brother Bear candidly
that he would rather give up his house and
lot than to be tossed around and cuffed at that
rate. Brother Bear said that he would rather
wrestle and have a jolly time than to take Brother
Tiger’s house; but Brother Tiger wouldn’t hear
to that. He said he couldn’t stay in that part of
the country and hear the talk of the neighbors.
They would pester him mighty near to death on
the week days, and fairly kill him out on Sunday,
when they had nothing to do but sit around and
gossip.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So Brother Tiger moved out, and Brother Bear
moved in; and it has come to pass that Brother
Tiger won’t stay in the same country with Brother
Bear for fear that he will have to do some
more wrestling.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c007'>XIX.<br /> <br />THE SHOEMAKER WHO MADE BUT ONE SHOE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Now, I’ll tell you honestly,” said Little Mr.
Thimblefinger, popping out from under Mr. Rabbit’s
big armchair, “I don’t like such stories.
They give me the all-overs. I expect maybe it’s
because they are true.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No doubt that’s the trouble with them,” remarked
Mr. Rabbit in a tone unusually solemn.
“You don’t think that at my time of life my
tongue is nimble enough for me to sit here and
make up stories to suit the hour and the company?
By the bye,” he continued, turning
around so as to catch Little Mr. Thimblefinger’s
eye, “what stories were you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, to tell you the truth, I was fast asleep,
for the most part, but I distinctly remember
something about Moons and Monkeys. When I
heard that, I just went off to sleep in spite of
myself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no accounting for tastes,” said Mr.
Rabbit. “There are some tales that put me to
sleep, and I have no complaint to make when anybody
begins to doze over them that I tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, you tell ’em well enough,” Little Mr.
Thimblefinger declared. “If anything, you make
them better than they ought to be. You lift
your ears at the right place, and pat your foot
when the time comes. I don’t know what more
could be asked in telling a story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far so good,” remarked Mrs. Meadows,
who had thus far said nothing. “Suppose you
whirl in and tell us the kind of tale that you
really admire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s easier said than done,” replied Little
Mr. Thimblefinger, fidgeting about a little. “You
have to take the tales as they come. Sometimes
one will pop into your head in spite of yourself.
You remember it just because you didn’t like it
when you first heard it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell us one, anyway, just to pass away the
time,” said Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I tell you one,” Little Mr. Thimblefinger
replied, “I’ll not promise it will be one that I
like. That would be promising too much. But
the talk about the Moon, that I heard before I
dozed off just now, reminded me of a tale I heard
when I was a good deal smaller than I am now.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once upon a time there was a man who had
two sons. They were twins, but they were just
as different from each other as they could possibly
be. One was dark, and the other was light complected.
One was slim, and the other was fat.
One was good, and the other was what people call
bad. He was lazy, and full of fun and mischief.
They grew up that way until they were nineteen
or twenty years old. The good boy would work
hard every day, or pretend to work hard, and then
he’d go back home and tell his mother and
father that his brother hadn’t done a stroke of
work. Of course, this made the old people feel
very queer. The mother felt sorrowful, and the
father felt angry. This went on, until finally, one
day, the father became so angry that he concluded
to take his bad son into some foreign
country, and bind him out to some person who
could make him work and cure him of his mischievousness.
In those days people sometimes
bound out their children to learn trades and good
manners and things of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish dey’d do it now,” exclaimed Drusilla.
“Kaze den I wouldn’t hafter be playin’ nuss, an’
be gwine in all kind er quare places whar you
dunner when ner whar you kin git out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stuff!” cried Buster John. “Why don’t
you be quiet and listen to the story?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It go long too slow fer ter suit me,” said
Drusilla in a grumbling tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger, turning
to Buster John, “you’ve come mighty close to
telling a part of the tale I had in my mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t see how,” replied Buster John with
some surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said ‘stuff!’” responded Mr. Thimblefinger,
“and that’s a part of my story. If you
listen, you’ll soon find out. As I was saying,
people in old times bound out their sons to some
good man, who taught them a good trade or
something of that kind. Well, this man that I
was telling you about took his bad son off to a
foreign country, and tried to find some one to
bind him out to. They traveled many days and
nights. They went over mountains and passed
through valleys. They crossed plains, and they
went through the wild woods.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, the man who was taking his son into a
foreign country was getting old, and the farther
they walked, the more tired he grew. At last,
one day, when they were going through the big
woods, he sat down to rest near a tall poplar-tree,
and, turning to his son, said angrily:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Stuff! you are not worth all this trouble.
But for you I’d be at home now, enjoying myself
and smoking my pipe.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The son, who was used to these outbreaks,
made no reply, but stretched himself out on the
dead leaves that littered the ground. He had
hardly done so when there was a tremendous noise
in the woods, and then both father and son saw
rushing toward them an old man with a long
beard, followed by a small army of fierce-looking
dwarfs armed with clubs and knives and pikes.
They rushed up and surrounded the father and
son.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Which of you called my name and abused
me?’ cried the old man with the long beard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not I,’ said the bad son.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not I,’ said the father. ‘I am sure I never
saw you or heard of you before.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“This made the old man more furious than
ever. He fairly trembled with rage. ‘Didn’t I
hear one of you say, “Stuff! but for you I’d
be at home now enjoying myself, and smoking
my pipe?”’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I did say something like that,’ replied the
father in great astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How dare you?’ cried the old man, beside
himself with rage. ‘How did I ever harm you?
Seize him!’ he said to his army of dwarfs.
‘Seize him, and bind him hard and fast! I’ll
show him whether he can come into my kingdom
and abuse me!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The father was speechless with astonishment,
and made no attempt to prevent the dwarfs from
seizing and binding him. They had him tied
hard and fast before he could say a word, even if
he had had a word to say. But by this time the
son had risen to his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Wait!’ he cried, ‘let’s see what the
trouble is! Who are you?’ he inquired, turning
to the old man with the long beard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘My name is Stuff,’ he replied, ‘and I am
king of this country which you are passing
through. I’m not going to allow any one to
abuse me in my own kingdom. You may go
free, but mind you go straight back the way you
came.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The son thought the matter over a little
while, and then turned on his heel and went back
the way he had come, and, as he walked, he
whistled all the lively tunes he could think of.
For a time he was glad that his father was no
longer with him to quarrel and complain; but
finally he grew lonely, and then he began to
think how his father had raised him up from a
little child. The more he thought about this, the
sorrier he was that he had given his father any
trouble. He sat down on a log by the side of the
road and thought it all over, and presently he
began to cry.</p>
<div id='i216'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i216.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A QUEER-LOOKING LITTLE MAN CAME JOGGING ALONG THE ROAD</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“While he was sitting there with his head
between his hands, crying over the fate of his
father, a queer-looking little man came jogging
along the road. He had bushy hair and a beard
that grew all over his face, except right around
his eyes and lips and the tip-end of his nose.
His beard was not long, but it was very thick,
and it stood out around his face like the spokes
in a buggy-wheel. He seemed to be in a big
hurry, but when he saw the young man sitting
on the log crying, he stopped, and stared at him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘What’s all this?
Who has hurt your feelings?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the young man had not been so sorrowful,
he would have been surprised to see the queer-looking
little man standing by him. But, as it
was, he didn’t seem to be surprised at all. He
just looked at the stranger with red eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘My name is Mum,’ said the stranger, ‘and
I’m the Man in the Moon. Tell me your
troubles. Maybe I can help you. I’m in a
great hurry, because the Moon must change day
after to-morrow, and I must be there to lend a
hand; but I’ll not allow my hurry to prevent me
from hearing your troubles and helping you if I
can.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So then and there the young man told his
story, and the Man in the Moon sighed heavily
when he heard it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I see how it is,’ he said. ‘You are young
and thoughtless, and your father is old and
crabbed. You never thought of what you owed
him, and he never made any allowances for your
youth. He’s in no danger. I know old Stuff
well. I’ve watched him many a night when he
thought nobody had an eye on him, and he’s a
pretty tough and cunning customer. You must
have help if you get your father out of trouble.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What am I to do?’ asked the young man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ replied the Man in the Moon, ‘in the
first place you will have to go home. Say nothing
about the trouble your father is in. Just
tell your mother that he has lost the sole of his
shoe, and has sent you for the awl that is in the
big red cupboard, a piece of leather, a handful of
pegs, and a piece of wax.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What then?’ the young man inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Bring them here,’ said the Man in the
Moon. ‘By the time you get back, I will have
another holiday. We’ll put our heads together
and see what can be done.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The young man made no delay. He was so
anxious about his father that he started for home
at once. It was a long journey, but he lost no
time on the way. He was in rags and tatters
when he reached home, but that made no difference
to him. He took no time to eat, or to
sleep, or to rest, but went to his mother at once,
and told her that his father had lost the sole of
his shoe, and had sent for the awl that lay in the
big red cupboard, a strong piece of leather, a
handful of shoe-pegs, and a cake of shoemaker’s
wax.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His mother asked him a great many questions,
as women will, but all the answer the son
would make was that his father had lost the
sole of his shoe, and had sent for the awl that
lay in the big red cupboard, a strong piece of
leather, a handful of shoe-pegs, and a cake of
shoemaker’s wax. Of course, the mother was
very much worried. She finally came to the conclusion
that some great calamity had befallen her
husband, and she went about crying and wringing
her hands, and declaring that they were all
ruined; that her husband was dead; and that
more than likely he had been murdered by this
bad, bad son of hers, who had no other story to
tell except to ask for the awl that lay in the big
red cupboard, a strong piece of leather, a handful
of shoe-pegs, and a cake of shoemaker’s wax.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, the good son heard all this, but he said
nothing. He just folded his hands and fetched
a sigh or two, and seemed to be sorry for everything
in general. But while the mother was
going about wringing her hands and weeping,
and the good son was heaving and fetching his
sighs, the other son went to the big red cupboard.
There on a shelf he saw the awl sticking in a
cake of shoemaker’s wax. Near it was a strong
piece of leather, and close by was a handful of
shoe-pegs. He took these, changed his ragged
coat, and started back on his journey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, although the good son did nothing but
sigh and look sorry, he had deep ideas of his
own. The reason he was called the good son was
because he was so cunning. He thought to himself
that now would be a good time to do a fine
stroke of business. He knew that his brother
had something more on his mind than the awl,
the leather, the pegs, and the shoemaker’s wax,
and he wanted to find out about it. So he ran
after his brother to ask him what the real trouble
was. He caught up with him a little way beyond
the limits of the village, but no satisfaction could
he get. Then he began to abuse his brother and
to accuse him of all sorts of things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the son, who was trying to get his father
out of trouble, paid no attention to this. He
went forward on his journey, turning his head
neither to the right nor to the left. The good
brother (as he was called) followed along after the
best he could, being determined to see the end of
the business. But somehow it happened that, on
the second day, the brother who was going to
meet the Man in the Moon was so tired and worn
out that he was compelled to crawl under a haystack
and go to sleep. In this way the good
brother passed him on the road and went forward
on his journey, never doubting that the other
was just ahead of him. Finally, one day, the
good brother grew tired and sat down on a log to
rest. He sat there so long that the brother he
thought he was following came up. He was very
much surprised to see his nice and good brother
sitting on a log and nodding in that country. So
he woke him up and asked him what the trouble
was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Stuff!’ cried the other, ‘you know you have
made way with our father!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“At once there was a roaring noise in the
woods and a rustling sound in the underbrush,
and out came an old man with a long beard, followed
by an army of dwarfs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How dare you abuse me in my own kingdom?’
he cried to the good brother. ‘How did
I ever harm you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The brother, who had seen this game played
before, tried to explain, but King Stuff would
listen to no explanation. He commanded his
armed dwarfs to seize and bind the good brother,
and they soon carried him out of sight in spite
of his cries.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, the young man who had gone home for
the awl and the axe and the shoemaker’s wax
was very much puzzled. He had more business
on his hands than he knew what to do with. He
saw that he must now rescue his brother as well
as his father, and he didn’t know how to go
about it. He had the awl and the axe and the
shoemaker’s wax. He also had the shoe-pegs and
leather that he found together. But what was he
to do with them? He sat on the log and
thought about it a long time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“While he was sitting there, and just as he
was about to go forward on his journey, he heard
some one coming briskly down the road singing.
He heard enough of the song to be very much
interested in it. It ran thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘With the awl and the axe</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the shoemaker’s wax,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the pegs and the leather</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That were found close together</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where the old man had fling’d ’em,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>We’ll bore through and roar through;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>We’ll cut down, we’ll put down,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This king and his kingdom.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Of course, it was the Man in the Moon who
was coming along the road singing the song, and
he seemed to be in high good humor. He caught
sight of the solemn face of the young man and
began to laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘There you are!’ cried Mum, the Man in the
Moon, ‘and I’m glad to see you; but I’d feel a
great deal better if you didn’t look so lonesome.
I don’t know what to do about it. Your face is
as long as a hind quarter of beef.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I can’t help it,’ replied the young man. ‘I
am in deeper trouble than ever. My brother has
been carried off by the same people that captured
my father.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What of it?’ exclaimed the Man in the
Moon. ‘If you knew as much about that brother
of yours as I do, you’d go on about your
business, and let him stay where he is.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No,’ said the young man. ‘I couldn’t do
that. I know he is my brother, and that is
enough. And then there’s my father.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Man in the Moon looked at the young
man a long time, and finally said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Since we are to have a sort of holiday together,
maybe you won’t mind telling me your
name.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, of course not,’ replied the young man.
‘My name is Smat.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Man in the Moon scratched his head and
then laughed. ‘It is a queer name,’ he said;
‘but I see no objection to it. I suppose it just
happened so.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now, I can’t tell you anything about that,’
replied Smat. ‘I was too young when the name
was given to take any part in the performance.
They seized me, and named me at a time when I
had to take any name that they chose to give me.
They named me Smat, and that was the end of it
so far as I was concerned. They never asked me
how I liked it, but just slapped the name in my
face, as you may say, and left it there.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ said the Man in the Moon, ‘they’ll
put another letter in the name when you get back
home. Instead of calling you Smat, they’ll say
you are Smart, and there’s some consolation in
that.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Not much as I can see,’ remarked Smat.
‘It’s all in your mouth, and what is in your
mouth is pretty much all wind and water, if you
try to spit it out. What I want now is to get
my father and my brother out of the trouble that
my mischief has plunged them in. Please help
me. They ought to be at home right now.
There’s the corn to grind, and the cows are waiting
to be milked, and the grain is to be gathered.
Times are pretty hard at our house when everybody
is away.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Very well,’ said the Man in the Moon. He
had hanging by his side the horn of the new
Moon, and on this he blew a loud blast. Immediately
there was a roaring noise in the woods,
and very soon there swarmed about them a company
of little men, all bearing the tiniest and the
prettiest lanterns that were ever seen. It was not
night, but their lanterns were blazing, and as they
marched around the Man in the Moon in regular
order, it seemed as though the light of their
lanterns had quenched that of the sun, so that
Smat saw the woods in a different light altogether.
He had not moved, but he seemed to
be in another country entirely. The trees had
changed, and the ground itself. He was no
longer sitting on a log by the side of the big
road, but was now standing on his feet in a
strange country, as it seemed to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He had risen from his seat on the log when
the little men with their lanterns began marching
around, but otherwise he had not moved. And
yet here he was in a country that was new to
him. He rubbed his eyes in a dazed way, and
when he opened them again, another change had
taken place. Neither he nor the Man in the
Moon had made any movement away from the big
road and the log that was lying by the side of
it, but now they were down in a wide valley, that
stretched as far as the eye could see, between two
high mountain ranges.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now, then,’ said the Man in the Moon, ‘you
must be set up in business. On the side of the
mountain yonder is the palace of King Stuff,
and somewhere not far away you will find your
father and your brother, and perhaps some one
else.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“He then called to the leaders of the little
men with the lanterns, and gave each one a task
to do. Their names were Drift and Sift, Glimmer
and Gleam, and Shimmer and Sheen. These six
leaders waved their lanterns about, called their
followers about them, and at once began to build
a house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And they so little, too,” remarked Mrs.
Meadows sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it was no trouble in the world to them,”
said Little Mr. Thimblefinger. “It didn’t seem
as if they were building a house. Did you ever
see a flower open? You look at it one minute,
turn your head away and forget about it, and the
next time you look, there it is open wide. That
was the way with this house the little men built.
It just seemed to grow out of the ground. As
it grew, the little men climbed on it, waved their
lanterns about, and the house continued to grow
higher and higher, and larger and larger, until it
was finished. Not a nail had been driven, not
a board had been rived, not a plank had been
planed, not a sill had been hewn, not a brick had
been burned. And yet there was the house all
new and fine, with a big chimney-stack in the
middle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now,’ said the Man in the Moon, when
everything was done, ‘here is your house, and
you may move in with bag and baggage.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is quickly done,’ replied Smat. ‘What
then?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, you must set up as a shoemaker,’ said
the Man in the Moon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But I never made a shoe in my life,’ the
young man declared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘So much the more reason why you should
make ’em before you die,’ the Man in the Moon
remarked. ‘The sooner you begin to make shoes,
the sooner you’ll learn how.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That’s so true,’ said Smat, ‘that I have
no reply to make. ‘I’ll do as you say, if I can.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That’s better,’ cried the Man in the Moon.
‘If you do that, you’ll have small trouble. If
you don’t, I wouldn’t like to tell you what will
happen. Now listen! There is in this kingdom
a person (I’ll not say who) that goes about
with only one shoe. When you see that person,
no matter when or where,—no matter whether
it’s man, woman, or child,—you must let it be
known that you are ready to make a shoe.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the Man in the Moon called to the
leaders of his army of lantern bearers, and waved
his hands. They, in turn, waved their tiny lanterns,
and in a moment all were out of sight, and
Smat was left alone. For some time afterwards
he felt both lonely and uneasy, but this feeling
passed away as soon as he went into his house.
He was so astonished by what he saw in there
that he forgot to feel uneasy. He saw that,
although the house was newly built,—if it had
been built,—it was in fact old enough inside to
seem like home. Every room was finely furnished
and carpeted, and in one part of the house, in a
sort of shed-room, he found that a shoemaker’s
shop had been fixed up. There he saw the awl
and the axe, and the shoemaker’s wax, with the
pegs and the leather that were found close together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He thought to himself that all that was very
nice, but he knew, too, that he was not much of
a shoemaker, and this bothered him not a little.
Anyhow, he made himself comfortable and waited
to see what was going to happen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One day a head officer of the kingdom
chanced to pass that way. He saw the house and
rubbed his eyes. He was so astonished that he
went and told another officer, and this officer told
another, and finally all the officers in the kingdom
knew about it. Now, if you’ve ever noticed,
those who hold government offices have less
to do and more time to do it in than any other
day laborers. So they went about and caucussed
among themselves, and examined into the books,
and found that no taxes had ever been gathered
from the owner of such a house. There was
great commotion among them. One of them,
more meddlesome than the rest, took a big book
under his arm and went to Smat’s house to make
inquiries. The first question he asked was the
last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘How long have you been living in
this precinct?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says Smat, ‘Ever since the house was built
and a little while before.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The officer looked at the house and saw that
it was a very old one, and then he tucked his big
book under his arm and went off home. At last
the king—the same King Stuff whose name
you’ve heard me mention—heard about the
new house that was old, and of the shoemaker
who didn’t know how to make shoes. So he concluded
to look into the matter. He summoned
his high and mighty men, and when they had
gathered together they went into a back room
of the palace and shut the door, and had a long
talk together. All this took time; and while the
king and his high and mighty men were confabbing
together, other things were happening, as
you shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It seems that in that kingdom there was a
beautiful girl who went wandering about the
country. If she had any kinsfolk, nobody knew
anything about it, and, indeed, nobody cared.
She had lost one of her shoes, and she went about
from place to place hunting for it. Some pitied
her, and some laughed at her, which is the way
of the world, as you’ll find out; but nobody
tried to help her. Some said that one shoe was
better than no shoe, and others said that a new
shoe would do just as well as an old shoe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s where they made a big mistake,” said
Mrs. Meadows. “I’ve tried it, and I ought to
know. A new shoe is bound to hurt you a little
at first, I don’t care how well it fits.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’m only telling you what they said,”
replied little Mr. Thimblefinger. “From all I
can hear, new shoes hurt the ladies a great deal
worse than they do the men. But that’s natural,
for their toes and their heels are a good deal
tenderer than those of the men folks. Anyhow,
this beautiful girl had lost one of her shoes, and,
rather than buy another one or a new pair, she
went hunting it everywhere. One day she came
by Smat’s house. He, sitting by one of the windows,
and wishing that he could see his father
and brother, paid no attention to the passers-by.
But this beautiful girl saw him at the window
and spoke to him.</p>
<div id='i232'  class='figcenter id021'>
<img src='images/i232.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING OF A STRAY SHOE?”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“‘Kind sir,’ she said, ‘have you seen anything
of a stray shoe? I have lost one of mine, and
I’m in great trouble about it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Smat looked at the girl, and she was so beautiful
that he couldn’t help but blush. Seeing
this, the girl began to blush. And so there they
were, two young things a-blushing at one another,
and wondering what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I have seen no stray shoe,’ said Smat; ‘but
if you’ll come in and show me the one you have
on, I think I’ll know its fellow when I see it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The girl went into the house and sat on a
chair, and showed Smat the shoe that she hadn’t
lost. She had the smallest and the neatest foot
he had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I hope you are no kin to Cinderella,’ said
Smat, ‘for then you couldn’t get a shoe to fit
your other foot until some kind fairy made it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I never heard of Cinderella,’ the girl replied.
‘I only know that I have lost my shoe,
and I’m afraid I’ll never get another just like it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Smat scratched his head, and then he thought
about the awl and the axe and the shoemaker’s
wax, and the pegs and the leather that were
found close together. So he said to the beautiful
girl:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Just sit here a little while, and I’ll see if I
can’t get you a shoe to fit your foot. But I must
have the other shoe as a pattern to work by.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“At first the girl didn’t want to trust him
with the shoe, but she saw that he was in earnest,
and so she pulled off the only shoe she had and
placed it in Smat’s hands. He saw at once that
the leather he had was a match for that in the
shoe, and he set to work with a light heart,—with
a light heart, but his hand was heavy.
And yet, somehow or other, he found that he
knew all about making shoes, although he had
never learned how. The leather fitted itself to
the last, and everything went smoothly. But the
beautiful girl, instead of feeling happy that she
would soon have a mate to her shoe, began to
grow sad. She sat in a corner with her head
between her hands and her hair hanging down to
her feet, and sighed every time Smat bored a hole
in the leather with his awl or drove in a peg.
Finally, when he handed her the shoe entirely
finished, she looked at it, sighed, and let it fall
from her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Of course,’ said Smat, ‘I don’t feel bad
over a little thing like that. But you don’t have
to pay anything for the shoe, and you don’t have
to wear it unless you want to.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, it is not that,’ cried the beautiful girl.
‘The shoe will do very well, but the moment I
put it on, your troubles will begin.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ replied Smat, ‘we must have troubles
of some sort anyhow, and the sooner they begin,
the sooner they’ll be ended. So put on your
shoe.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, it happened that just as the girl put
on the shoe, which fitted her foot exactly, King
Stuff and his councilors came driving up to the
door. King Stuff was not a large man, but he
was very fierce-looking. He called out from his
carriage of state and asked what sort of a person
lived in that house that he couldn’t come out
and salute when the king and his councilors went
riding by. Smat went to the door and bowed as
politely as he could, and said that he would have
been glad to bow and salute, if he had known his
royal highness and their excellent excellencies intended
to honor his poor house even so much as
to pass by it. The king and his councilors looked
at one another and shook their heads.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘This man is none of us,’ said the oldest and
wisest of the councilors. ‘We must be careful.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How long have you lived here?’ asked the
king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Longer than I wanted to,’ replied Smat.
‘My house is so far from the palace that I have
not been able to call and pay my respects to your
majesty.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I see you are a maker of shoes,’ remarked
the king, seeing the awl in Smat’s hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No, your majesty, not a maker of shoes, but
simply a shoemaker. Thus far I have succeeded
in making only one shoe.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“At this the king and his councilors began to
shake and tremble. ‘What was the prophecy?’
cried the king to the oldest and wisest. ‘Repeat
it!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The oldest and the wisest closed his eyes,
allowed his head to drop to one side, and said in
solemn tones:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Wherever you go, and whatever you do,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Beware of the man that makes but one shoe;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Beware of the man with the awl and the axe,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With the pegs and the leather and the shoemaker’s wax.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If you’re out of your palace when you meet this man,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You’d better get back as fast as you can.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Smat felt very much like laughing at the
solemn way in which the oldest and wisest councilor
repeated this prophecy, or whatever it might
be called. ‘Your majesty needn’t be worried
about that prophecy,’ said he. ‘It’s the easiest
thing in the world to break the force of it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘How?’ asked the king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, having made one shoe, I’ll go to work
and make another,’ replied Smat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The oldest and wisest of the councilors said
that was a pretty good plan,—anyhow, it was
worth trying. Smat promised to make another
shoe, and have it ready in two days. But this
was easier said than done. In the first place, he
had used nearly all his leather in making a shoe
for the beautiful girl. In the second place, the
awl point wouldn’t stay in the handle. In the
third place, the pegs split and broke every time
he tried to drive them, and the shoemaker’s wax
wouldn’t stick. Everything went wrong at first
and grew worse at last, so that when the king
sent his officers for the shoe it was no nearer done
than it had been before Smat began.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The beautiful girl had not gone very far
away, and she came every day to see how Smat
prospered in making the second shoe. She was
watching him when the king’s officers came for
the shoe, and when she saw them she began to
weep. But Smat looked as cheerful as ever, and
even began to whistle when the officers knocked
at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘We are in a fix,’ said he, ‘but we’ll get
out of it. Lend me the shoe I made for you.
I’ll send that to the king and then get it back
again.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The girl tried to take the shoe from her foot,
but nothing would move it. ‘That is a sign,’
said Smat, ‘that it ought not to come off. I’ll
just go to the king myself and tell him the facts
in the case. That is the best way.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So he gathered the awl and the axe and the
shoemaker’s wax, and the scraps of leather, and
bundled them together. Then he told the officers
that he would go with them and carry the shoe
himself, so as to be sure that it came safely into
the king’s hands. They went toward the palace,
and Smat noticed, as they went along, that it
grew darker and darker as they came nearer to
the palace. The officers seemed to notice it too.
By the time they reached the palace, it was so
dark that Smat had great trouble in keeping up
with the officers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was great commotion in the palace.
Nobody had ever seen it so dark before except
just at the stroke of midnight, when the shadows
grow thick and heavy and run together and over
everything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, old King Stuff was a sort of magician
himself (as, indeed, he had to be in those times,
in order to manage a kingdom properly), and as
soon as he saw the great darkness coming on at
the wrong time of day, he thought at once of the
prophecy in regard to the man who made but one
shoe. So he hustled and bustled around the
palace, calling for the officers he had sent after
the shoe. But nobody had seen them return before
the dark began to fall, and after that it was
impossible to see them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the midst of it all, the officers, followed
by Smat, stumbled into the palace and went
groping about from room to room hunting for
old King Stuff and his ministers. At last, they
heard him grumbling and growling, and felt their
way toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The shoe! the shoe!’ cried King Stuff,
when the officers had made themselves known.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I have something that will answer just as
well,’ said Smat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The shoe! give me the shoe!’ cried the
king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Take this, your majesty,’ said Smat, handing
him the bundle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No sooner had the king’s hands touched the
bundle than there was a rumbling noise in the
air, the building began to shake and totter and
crumble away. In the midst of it all some one
cried out in a loud voice:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Wherever you go, and whatever you do,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Beware of the man that makes but one shoe!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“In the twinkling of an eye, King Stuff and
his army and his palace had disappeared from
sight. At the same time the darkness had cleared
away, and Smat saw his father and his brother
standing near, dazed and frightened, and not far
away was the beautiful girl. The father and the
brother were very much astonished when they
found that Smat had been the means of their
rescue. They talked about it until night fell,
and then the Man in the Moon, with his tiny lantern-bearers,
came and escorted them to their own
country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now it happened that the beautiful girl was
a princess, the daughter of the king. It fell to
the lot of Smat to take the princess home. Not
long after that the king gave a great festival, to
celebrate the return of his daughter. Smat’s
father and brother got close enough to the palace
to see him standing in a large room, where there
was a large crowd of people and music and
flowers. They saw, too, that he was holding the
princess by the hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And so,” said little Mr. Thimblefinger, wiping
the perspiration from his forehead, “the story
ended.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c007'>XX.<br /> <br />THE WOOG AND THE WEEZE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Phew!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit, when he was
sure that little Mr. Thimblefinger had finished.
“That beats anything I ever heard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad you like it,” said Mr. Thimblefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, hold on there!” protested Mr. Rabbit,
“you are going too fast. I never said I liked it.
I said it beat any story I ever heard, and so it
does,—for length. I didn’t know that such a
little chap could be so long-winded. It was such
a long story that I’ve forgotten what the moral
ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I thought you said you didn’t believe
much in stories that had morals tacked to them,”
remarked Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No doubt I did,” replied Mr. Rabbit,—“No
doubt I did. But this story was long enough
to have a dozen morals cropping out in different
places, like dog fennel in a cow pasture.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, “there was a
moral or two in the story, but I didn’t call attention
to them in the telling, and I’ll not dwell on
them now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought it was a tolerably fair story,” said
Buster John, yet with a tone of doubt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I thought it was splendid all the way
through,” said Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some stories that are hard to tell,”
suggested Mrs. Meadows. “They go in such a
rambledy-wambledy way that it’s not easy to
keep the track of them. I remember I once heard
Chickamy Crany Crow trying to repeat a story
that she heard the Looking-glass Children tell.
I never found head nor tail to it, but I sat and
listened almost without shutting my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the story?” asked Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>In reply, Mrs. Meadows said she would call
Chickamy Crany Crow, and ask her to tell it.
As usual, Chickamy Crany Crow was off at play
with Tickle-My-Toes. They both came when
Mrs. Meadows called them, and Chickamy Crany
Crow, after some persuasion, began to tell the
story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One day,” she said, brushing her hair behind
her ears with her fingers, “I wanted to see the
Looking-glass Children. Tickle-My-Toes was off
playing by himself, and I was lonesome; so I
went to the Looking-glass, whirled it around in
its frame, and waited for the children to come
out. But they didn’t come. I called them, but
they made no answer. I went close to the Glass,
and looked in. At first, I couldn’t see anything;
but after a while I saw, away off in the Glass,
one of the children,—the one they all say looks
like me. I called her; but she was so far off in
the Glass that she couldn’t hear me, and, as she
had her face turned the other way, she couldn’t
see me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After so long a time, she came up to the
frame of the Glass, and then stepped out and sat
down on the ground. I saw she had been crying.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘Honey, what in the world is the
matter?’ I always call her Honey when we are
by ourselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says she, ‘There’s enough the matter. I’m
e’en about scared to death, and I expect that all
the other children in this Looking-glass are either
captured, or killed, or scared to death.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘Why didn’t you holler for help?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says she, ‘What good would that have done?
You all could help us very well on dry land, out
here, but how could you have helped us in the
Looking-glass, when you can’t even get in at
the door? I’ve seen you try to follow us, but
you’ve always failed. You stop at the Glass,
and you can’t get any farther.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘You are right about that; but if
we outside folks can’t get in the Glass to play
with you and keep you company, how can anybody
or anything get in there to scare you and
hurt you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says she, ‘The thing that scared us has been
in there all the time. It was born in there, I
reckon, but I’ve never seen it before; and I tell
you right now I never want to see it again.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘What sort of a thing is it?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says she in a whisper, ‘<i>It’s the Woog!</i>‘</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘The what?’ says I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘<i>The Woog!</i>‘ says she.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says I, ‘It’s new to me. I never heard of it
before.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says she, ‘To hear of it is as close as you
want to get to it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I heard of the Woog in my younger
days,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger. “I thought
the thing had gone out of fashion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe a word of it,” said Chickamy
Crany Crow. “It’s just as much in fashion
now as ever it was, especially at certain seasons of
the year. The little girl in the Looking-glass—I
say little girl, though she’s about my size and
shape—told me all about it; and as she lives in
the same country with the Woog, she ought to
know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did she say about it?” asked Buster
John, who had a vague idea that he might some
day be able to organize an expedition to go in
search of the Woog.</p>
<div id='i244'  class='figcenter id022'>
<img src='images/i244.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A HORRIBLE MONSTER GLARED AT THEM</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Well,” replied Chickamy Crany Crow, “she
said this,—she said that she and the other children
were sitting under the shade of a bazzle-bush
in the Looking-glass, telling fairy stories.
It had come her turn to tell a story, and she was
trying to remember the one about the little girl
who had a silk dress made out of a muscadine
skin, when all of a sudden there was a roaring
noise in the bushes near by. While they were
shaking with fright, a most horrible monster came
rushing out, and glared at them, growling all the
while. It wore great green goggles. Its hair
stood out from its head on all sides, except in the
bald place on top, and its ears stuck out as big as
the wings of a buzzard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Do you know who I am?’ it growled.
‘No, you don’t; but I’ll show you. I am the
Woog. Do you hear that? The Woog! Don’t
forget that. What did I hear you talking about
just now? You were talking about fairies.
Don’t say you weren’t, for I heard you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ says one of the Looking-glass Children,
‘what harm is there in that?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Harm!’ screamed the Woog. ‘Do you
want to defy me? I have caught and killed and
crushed and smoked out all the fairies that ever
lived on the earth, except a few that have hid
themselves in this Looking-glass country. What
harm, indeed!—a pretty question to ask me,
when I’ve spent years and years trying to run
down and smother out the whole fairy tribe.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Looking-glass Children,” Chickamy
Crany Crow continued, “told the Woog that they
didn’t know there was any harm in the fairies
themselves, or in talking about them. The Woog
paid no attention to their apologies. He just
stood and glared at them through his green goggles,
gnashing his teeth and clenching his hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says the monster after awhile, ‘How dare
any of you wish that you could see a fairy, or
that you had a fairy godmother? What shall I
do with you? I crushed a whole population of
fairies between the lids of this book’ (he held
up a big book, opened it, and clapped it together
again so hard that it sounded like some one had
fired off a gun), ‘and I’ve a great mind to
smash every one of you good-for-nothing children
the same way.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may be sure that by this time the poor
little Looking-glass Children were very much
frightened, especially when they saw that the
Woog was fixing to make an attack on them.
He dropped his big book, and when the children
saw him do this they broke and run: some went
one way and some another. The last they saw of
him, he was rushing through the bushes like a
blind horse, threshing his arms about, and doing
more damage to himself than to anybody else.
But the children had a terrible scare, and if he
hasn’t made way with some of them it’s not
because he is too good to do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The poor dears!” exclaimed Mrs. Meadows
sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dat ar creetur can’t come out’n dat Lookin’-glass
like de yuthers, kin he?” inquired Drusilla,
moving about uneasily: “kaze ef he kin, I’m
gwine ’way fum here. I dun seed so many quare
doin’s an’ gwine’s on dat I’ll jump an’ holler ef
anybody pints der finger at me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Tar-Baby,” replied Mr. Rabbit with
some dignity, “he hasn’t never come out yet.
That’s all that can be said in that line. He may
come out, but if he does you’ll be in no danger
at all. The Woog would never mistake you for
a fairy, no matter whether he had his green
goggles on or whether he had them off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No matter ’bout dat,” remarked Drusilla.
“I mayn’t look like no fairy, but I don’t want
no Woog fer ter be cuttin’ up no capers ’roun’
me. I tell you dat, an’ I don’t charge nothin’
fer tellin’ it. Black folks don’t stan’ much chance
wid dem what knows ’em, let ’lone dem ar Woog
an’ things what don’t know ’em. Ef you all hear
’im comin’, des give de word, and I boun’ you’ll
say ter yo’se’f dat Drusilla got wings. Now you
min’ dat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What does the Woog want to kill the fairies
for?” asked Sweetest Susan. “He must be very
mean and cruel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s all of that, and more,” replied Mrs.
Meadows. “The fairies please the children, and
give them something beautiful to think about in
the day and to dream about at night, and the
Woog doesn’t like that. He hates the fairies
because it pleases the children to hear about
them, and he hates the children because they like
to hear about the fairies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I never want to see him until I am big
enough to tote a gun,” said Buster John. “After
that, I don’t care how soon I meet him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, turning to Mrs.
Meadows with a solemn air, “didn’t you say
that all this about the Woog was a tale, or something
of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe I did,” replied Mrs. Meadows.
“What about it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just this,” said Mr. Rabbit,—“a tale’s a
tale, and it never stops until all is told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that’s the case, I’ve heard some here
that overshot the mark,” remarked Mrs. Meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No doubt, no doubt,” responded Mr. Rabbit.
“But what became of the Woog?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know! I know!” cried Tickle-My-Toes,
who had been listening to all that was said about
the Woog.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well; let’s hear about it,” suggested
Mr. Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Taint much,” said Tickle-My-Toes modestly.
“The chap in the Looking-glass that looks like
me, he was the one that fell into the hands or the
claws of the Woog. He could have got away
with the rest, but a piece of straw was caught
between his toes, and it tickled him so that he
laughed until he couldn’t run. He just fell on
the ground and rolled over and over, laughing all
the time. In this way the Woog caught up with
him and grabbed him, and carried him away off
in the woods in the Looking-glass country. They
were away off in that part of the country where
there was no green grass on the ground. There
were no green leaves on the trees, no flowers
blooming, and no birds singing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Woog carried the little chap that looks
like me to that dark place, and nearly scared him
to death.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You pretend to be something or somebody,
do you?—you, a shadow in a glass,’ growled the
Woog.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m what I am,’ said the little chap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘You are not,’ cried the Woog. ‘You are
nothing. Why do you pretend to be somebody
or something?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little chap didn’t say anything in reply,
because there was nothing to say. There’s no use
in disputing when you can’t help yourself. So
the Woog took him and tied him to a dead tree,
leaving his big book lying near. There is no
telling what would have happened to the little
chap; but just as soon as the Woog got out of
sight, a strong, tall man, with gray hair combed
straight back over his head, suddenly made his
appearance, and untied the cords, and set the
little chap free.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said the tall man; ‘I
am the Weeze. I have been hunting the Woog
for many a long day, and now I think I’ll put
an end to him.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Presently the Woog came back growling and
grumbling. When he looked up and saw the
Weeze, it was too late for him to escape. But he
turned and tried to run. Just then the Weeze
seized the big book and threw it at the Woog.
As it hit him, there was a big explosion, and the
Woog and his big book both disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little chap that looks like me,” said
Tickle-My-Toes, “was telling me about it to-day;
and he said that it wasn’t long after the explosion
before the flowers began to bloom in that
place, and the birds to sing, and the leaves began
to grow on the trees. And after awhile the
fairies began to peep out from their hiding-places;
and when the little chap came away he
could see them playing Ring-Around-Rosy on the
green grass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was mighty funny, wasn’t it?” asked
Tickle-My-Toes, in conclusion.</p>

  <h2 id='ch21' class='c007'>XXI.<br /> <br />UNCLE RAIN AND BROTHER DROUTH.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Now I’m not so mighty certain that that is a
real tale after all,” said Mr. Rabbit, “although it
took two to tell it. There’s something the matter
with it somewhere. The running-gear is out
of order. I’m not complaining, because what
might suit me might not suit other people. It’s
all a matter of taste, as Mrs. Meadows’s grandmother
said when she wiped her mouth with her
apron and kissed the cow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger, “there’s
no telling what happens in a Looking-glass when
nobody is watching. I’ve often wanted to know.
The little that I’ve heard about the Woog and
the Weeze will do me until I can hear more.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I remember a story that I thought was a
very good one when I first heard it,” said Mrs.
Meadows. “But sometimes a great deal more
depends on the time, place, and company than
on the stories that are told. I’m such a poor
hand at telling tales that I’m almost afraid to tell
any that I know. I’ve heard a great many in
my day and time, but the trouble is to pick out
them that don’t depend on a wink of the eye and
a wave of the hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give us a taste of it, anyhow,” suggested
Mr. Rabbit. “I’ll do the winking, the Tar-Baby
can do the blinking, and Mr. Thimblefinger can
wave his hands.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mrs. Meadows, “once upon a
time there lived in a country not very far from
here a man who had a wife and two children,—a
boy and a girl. This was not a large family,
but the man was very poor, and he found it a hard
matter to get along. He was a farmer, and farming,
no matter what they say, depends almost
entirely on the weather. Now, this farmer never
could get the weather he wanted. One year the
Rain would come and drown out his crops, and
the next year the Drouth would come and burn
them up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Matters went from bad to worse, and the
farmer and his wife talked of nothing else but
the Rain and the Drouth. One year they said
they would have made a living but for the
Drouth, and the next they said they would have
been very well off but for the Rain. So it went
on from year to year until the two children,—the
boy and the girl,—grew up large enough
to understand what their father and mother were
talking about. One year they’d hear they could
have no Sunday clothes and shoes because of the
Drouth. The next year they’d hear they could
have no shoes and Sunday clothes because of the
Rain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All this set them to thinking. The boy was
about ten years old and the girl was about nine.
One day at their play they began to talk as they
had heard their father and mother talk. It was
early in the spring, and their father was even
then ploughing and preparing his fields for planting
another crop.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘We will have warm shoes and good clothes
next winter if the Rain doesn’t come and stay
too long,’ said the boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes,’ replied the girl, ‘and we’ll have good
clothes and warm shoes if the Drouth doesn’t
come and stay too long.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I wonder why they’ve got such a spite
against us,’ remarked the boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ replied the girl.
‘If we go and see them, and tell them who we
are, and beg them not to make us so cold and
hungry when the ice grows in the ponds and on
the trees, maybe they’ll take pity on us.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“This plan pleased the boy, and the two children
continued to talk it over, until finally they
agreed to go in search of the Rain and the
Drouth. ‘Do you,’ said the boy, ‘go in search
of Brother Drouth, and I will go in search of
Uncle Rain. When we have found them, we
must ask them to visit our father’s house and
farm, and see the trouble and ruin they have
caused.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“To this the girl agreed; and early the next
morning, after eating a piece of corn bread, which
was all they had for breakfast, they started on
their journey, the boy going to the east and the
girl to the south. The boy traveled a long way,
and for many days. Sometimes he thought he
would never come to the end of his journey; but
finally he came to Cousin Mist’s house, and there
he inquired his way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What do you want with Uncle Rain?’ asked
Cousin Mist. ‘He is holding court now, and he
is very busy. Besides, you are not dressed
properly. When people go to court, they have
to wear a certain kind of dress. In your case,
you ought to have a big umbrella and an oilcloth
overcoat.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well,’ replied the boy, ‘I haven’t got ’em,
and that’s the end of that part of it. If you’ll
show me the way to Uncle Rain’s house, I’ll go
on and be much obliged to boot.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cousin Mist looked at the boy and laughed.
‘You are a bold lad,’ he said, ‘and since you are
so bold, I’ll lend you an umbrella and an oilcloth
overcoat, and go a part of the way with
you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the boy put on the overcoat and hoisted
the umbrella, and trudged along the muddy road
toward the house of Uncle Rain. When they
came in sight of it, Cousin Mist pointed it out,
told the boy good-by, and then went drizzling
back home. The boy went forward boldly, and
knocked at the door of Uncle Rain’s house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Who is there?’ inquired Uncle Rain in a
hoarse and wheezy voice. He seemed to have the
asthma, the choking quinsy, and the croup, all
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘It’s only me,’ said the boy. ‘Please, Uncle
Rain, open the door.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With that, Uncle Rain opened the door and
invited the little fellow in. He did more than
that: he went to the closet and got out a dry
spot, and told the boy to make himself as comfortable
as he could.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got out a—what?” asked Buster John,
trying hard to keep from laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A dry spot,” replied Mrs. Meadows solemnly.
“Uncle Rain went to the closet and got out a
dry spot. Of course,” she continued, “Uncle
Rain had to keep a supply of dry spots on hand,
so as to make his visitors comfortable. It’s a
great thing to be polite. Well, the boy sat on
the dry spot, and, after some remarks about the
weather, Uncle Rain asked him why he had come
so far over the rough roads. Then the boy told
Uncle Rain the whole story about how poor his
father was, and how he had been made poorer
year after year, first by Brother Drouth and then
by Uncle Rain. And then he told how he and
his little sister had to go without shoes and wear
thin clothes in cold weather, all because the crops
were ruined year after year, either by Brother
Drouth or Uncle Rain.</p>
<div id='i258'  class='figcenter id023'>
<img src='images/i258.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BOY TOLD UNCLE RAIN THE WHOLE STORY</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“He told his story so simply and with so much
feeling that Uncle Rain was compelled to wipe
his eyes on a corner of the fog that hung on the
towel rack behind the door. He asked the boy a
great many questions about his father and his
mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I reckon,’ said Uncle Rain finally, ‘that I
have done all of you a great deal of damage
without knowing it, but I think I can pay it
back. Bring the dry spot with you, and come
with me.’ He went into the barnyard, and the
boy followed. They went into the barn, and
there the boy saw, tied by a silver cord, a little
black sheep. It was very small, but seemed to
be full grown, because it had long horns that
curled round and round on the sides of its head.
And, although the horns were long and hard, the
little sheep was very friendly. It rubbed its head
softly against the boy’s hand, and seemed to be
fond of him at first sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uncle Rain untied the silver cord, and placed
the loose end in the boy’s hand. ‘Here is a
sheep,’ he said, ‘that is worth more than all the
flocks in the world. When you want gold, all
you have to do is to press the golden spring
under the left horn. The horn will then come
off, and you will find it full of gold. When you
want silver, press the silver spring under the
right horn. The horn will come off, and you will
find it full of silver. When the horns have been
emptied, place them back where they belong.
This may be done once, twice, or fifty times a
day.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boy didn’t know how to thank Uncle
Rain enough for this wonderful gift. He was so
anxious to get home that he would have started
off at once.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Wait a minute,’ said Uncle Rain. ‘You
may tell your father about this, but he must tell
no one else. The moment the secret of the sheep
is told outside your family, it will no longer be
valuable to you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boy thanked Uncle Rain again, and
started home, leading his wonderful sheep, which
trotted along after him, as if it were glad to go
along. The boy went home much faster than he
had gone away, and it was not long before he
reached there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what became of the little girl?” asked
Sweetest Susan, as Mrs. Meadows paused a moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am coming to her now,” said Mrs. Meadows.
“The girl, according to the bargain that had
been made between her and her brother, was to
visit Brother Drouth, and lay her complaints before
him. So she started on her way. As she
went along, the roads began to get drier and
drier, and the grass on the ground and the leaves
on the trees began to look as if they had been
sprinkled with yellow powder. By these signs,
the girl knew that she was not far from the house
of Cousin Dust, and presently she saw it in the
distance. She went to the door, which was
open, and inquired the way to Brother Drouth’s.
Cousin Dust was much surprised to see a little
girl at his door; but, after a long fit of coughing,
he recovered himself, and told her that she
was now in Brother Drouth’s country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘If you’ll show me the way,’ said the girl,
‘I’ll be more than obliged to you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’ll go a part of the way with you,’ said
Cousin Dust, ‘and lend you a fan besides.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they went along until they came in sight
of Brother Drouth’s house, and then Cousin Dust
went eddying back home in the shape of a small
whirlwind. The girl went to Brother Drouth’s
door and knocked. Brother Drouth came at
once and opened the door, and invited her in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’ll not deny that I’m surprised,’ said he,
‘for I never expected to find a little girl knocking
at my door at this time of day. But you
are welcome. I’m glad to see you. You must
have come a long journey, for you look hot.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“With that he went to the cupboard and got
her a cool place to sit on, and this she found very
comfortable. But still Brother Drouth wasn’t
satisfied. As his visitor was a little girl, he
wanted to be extra polite, and so he went to his
private closet and brought her a fresh breeze with
a handle to it; and, as the cool place had a
cushioned back and the fresh breeze a handle that
the girl could manage, she felt better in Brother
Drouth’s house than she had at any time during
her long journey. She sat there on the cool
place and fanned with the fresh breeze, and
Brother Drouth sat in his big armchair and
smiled at her. The little girl noticed this after
awhile, and so she said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, you can laugh, but it’s no laughing matter.
If you could see the trouble you’ve caused
at our house, you’d laugh on the other side of
your mouth.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“When he heard this, Brother Drouth at
once became very serious, and apologized. He
said he wasn’t laughing, but just smiling because
he thought she was enjoying herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I may be enjoying myself now,’ said the
little girl, ‘and I’m much obliged to you; but if
I was at home, I shouldn’t be enjoying myself.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then she went on to tell Brother Drouth
how her father’s crops had been ruined year after
year, either by Uncle Rain or by Brother Drouth,
and how the family got poorer and poorer all the
time on that account, so that the little children
couldn’t have warm shoes and thick clothes in
cold weather, but had to go barefooted and wear
rags. Brother Drouth listened with all his ears;
and when the little girl had told her story, he
shook his head, and said that he was to blame
as well as Uncle Rain. He explained that, for
many years, there had been a trial of strength
going on between him and Uncle Rain, and they
had become so much interested in overcoming
each other that they had paid no attention to
poor people’s crops. He said he was very sorry
that he had taken part in any such affair. Then
he told the little girl that he thought he could
pay her back for a part of the damage he had
done, and that he would be more than glad to
do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘Bring your cool place and your
fresh breeze with you, and come with me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“She followed Brother Drouth out into the
barnyard, and into the barn; and there, tied by
a golden cord, she saw a snow-white goat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘This goat,’ said Brother Drouth, ‘is worth
more than all the goats in the world, tame or
wild.’ With that he untied the golden cord, and
placed the loose end in the girl’s hand. The
goat was small, but seemed to be old; for its
horns, which were of the color of ivory, curved
upward and over its back. They were so long
that, by turning its head a bit, the snow-white
goat could scratch itself on its ham. And
though it seemed to be old, it was very gentle;
for it rubbed its nose and face against the little
girl’s frock, and appeared to be very glad to see
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now then,’ said Brother Drouth, ‘this goat
is yours. Take it, and take care of it. On the
under side of each horn, you will find a small
spring. Touch it, and the horn will come off;
and each horn, no matter how many times you
touch the spring, you will always find full of gold
and silver. But this is not all. At each change
of the moon, you will find the right horn full of
diamonds, and the left horn full of pearls. Now
listen to me. You may tell your father about
this treasure; but as soon as the secret is told
out of the family, your goat will be worth no
more to you than any other goat.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The little girl thanked Brother Drouth until
he would allow her to thank him no more. She
would have left the cool place and the fresh
breeze, but Brother Drouth said she was welcome
to both of them. ‘When the weather is cold,’
said he, ‘you can put them away; but when it is
warm, you will find that the cool place and the
fresh breeze will come in right handy.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanking Brother Drouth again and again,
the girl started on her journey home, leading her
wonderful goat, and carrying with her the cool
place and the fresh breeze. In this way, she
made the long journey with ease and comfort,
and came to her father’s house without any
trouble. She reached the gate, too, just as her
brother did. They were very glad to see each
other, and the sheep and the goat appeared to be
old friends; for they rubbed their noses together
in friendly fashion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’ll make our father and mother rich,’ said
the boy proudly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘And I’ll make them richer,’ said the girl
still more proudly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they took their wonderful goat and sheep
into the stable, gave them some hay to eat, and
then went into the house.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c007'>XXII.<br /> <br />THE SNOW-WHITE GOAT AND THE COAL-BLACK SHEEP.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Please don’t say that is the end of the
story,” said Sweetest Susan, as Mrs. Meadows
made a longer pause than usual.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it ought to be the end,” replied Mrs.
Meadows. “The two children had come home
with treasure and riches enough to suit anybody.
That ought to be the end of the story.
You ought to be able to say that they all lived
happily together forever after. That’s the way
they put it down in the books; but this is not a
book story, and so we’ll have to stick to the
facts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then, when the boy and the girl returned
home, one with the wonderful sheep and
the other with the wonderful goat, they found
their father and mother in a great state of mind.
The whole country round about had been searched
for the children. The mother was sure they had
been stolen and carried off. The father, who had
his own miseries always in mind, was sure that
they had grown tired of the poverty that surrounded
them, and had run away to see if they
couldn’t do better among strangers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, when the children had returned home,
as happy as larks, their mother fell to weeping,
and cried out: ‘I am so glad you have escaped,
my pretty dears.’ The father grinned and said:
‘Why do you come back? Is it because the
fare elsewhere is no better than it is here?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, of course, the children didn’t know
what to make of all this. They stood with their
fingers in their mouths, and wondered what the
trouble was. Then they were compelled to answer
a shower of questions; and by the time the
inquiries had come to an end, they were not feeling
very comfortable at all. Finally the boy
said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘My sister and myself were tired of wearing
ragged clothes and having little to eat, and so we
concluded to seek our fortunes. We knew that
Uncle Rain and Brother Drouth had caused all
the trouble, and so we thought the best way to do
would be to hunt them up and tell them the
trouble they were causing to one poor family. I
went to see Uncle Rain, and my sister went to see
Brother Drouth. We found them at home, and
both were in good humor. Uncle Rain gave me
a coal-black sheep, and Brother Drouth gave my
sister a snow-white goat, and told us that with
these we could make our fortunes.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘A likely story—a very likely story indeed!’
exclaimed the father. ‘If you have brought the
sheep and the goat home, you would do well to
take them back where you got them, else we shall
all be put in jail for stealing and for harboring
stolen property.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Now don’t talk that way to your own children,’
said the tender-hearted mother. ‘For my
part, I believe every word they say;’ then she
kissed them, and hugged them, and cried over
them a little, while the father sat by, looking sour
and glum. The children, when they placed the
goat and the sheep in the stable, had each taken
a handful of gold and silver coins from the horns
of the wonderful animals. So now the boy went
forward and placed upon the table near his father
a handful of gold and silver. The girl did the
same.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The father heard the rattle and jingle of coin,
and, looking around, saw there at his elbow more
money than he had ever seen before in all his
life. He was both astonished and alarmed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Worse and worse!’ he cried, throwing up
his hands. ‘Worse and worse! We are ruined!
Tell me where you got that treasure, that I may
take it back to its owner. Make haste! If there’s
any delay about it, we shall all be thrown into
prison.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Come with us,’ said the boy, ‘and we will
show you where we found the treasure.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“So they went out of the house and into the
stable, and there the children showed their father
where the treasure came from.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Wonderful! most wonderful!’ exclaimed
the father. ‘Wonderful! most wonderful!’ cried
the mother. Then they hugged and kissed their
children again and again, and all were very happy.
It made no difference now whether crops were
good or bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man was mighty honest,” remarked Mr.
Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Meadows. “But a man can
be honest and thick-headed at the same time, and
that was the way with this man. He was too
honest to keep other people’s money, and too
thick-headed to know how to keep his own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me!” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit, with a
bow that made his ears flop; “excuse me! I
thought the story had come to an end. You said
they were all very happy; so I says to myself,
‘Now is the time to make a slight remark.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; the end of the story is yet to come,”
replied Mrs. Meadows. “But if these children are
getting tired, I’m ready to quit. Goodness
knows, I don’t want to worry them, and I don’t
want to make them think that I want to do all the
talking.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please go on,” said Sweetest Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, when the father found where the
money and treasure came from, he was willing to
believe that his children had visited Uncle Rain
and Brother Drouth; for he knew perfectly well
that the wonderful black sheep and the wonderful
snow-white goat were not bred on any farm in
that country. So his mind was easy; and, as I
said, the father, the mother, and the two children
were all happy together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The mother and the children were so happy
that they stayed at home and enjoyed one another’s
company, and the father was so happy
that it made him restless in the mind. He got
in the habit of going to the tavern every day,
and sometimes more than once a day; and he
got to drinking more ale and wine than was good
for him. And on these occasions his legs would
wobble under him, as if one leg wanted to go
home, and the other wanted to go back to the
tavern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sometimes, at the tavern, he would get to
gaming; and when he lost his money, as he always
did, he’d ask his companions to wait until
he could go home and get more. He would
soon come back with his pockets full. This happened
so often that people began to talk about it,
and to wonder how a man who had been so very
poor could suddenly become so wealthy that he
had money to throw away at the gaming-table.
His neighbors were very curious about it, but
they asked him no questions, and he went on
drinking and gambling for many long days.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But finally there came to that village a company
of five men, who let it be understood that
they were peddlers. They came into the village
on foot, carrying packs on their backs, and put
up at the tavern. They were not peddlers, but
robbers, who had been attracted to the village by
rumors about the poor man who was rich enough
to throw away money night after night at the
gaming-table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shortly after nightfall, three of the five men
arranged themselves around a table; and when
the man came in, they invited him to join them.
Two of the five sat by the fire, and appeared to
be watching the game. The man didn’t wait
for two invitations, but seated himself at the
table, and called for wine. Then the gaming
began. Aided by their two companions, the
three robbers at the table had no difficulty in
swindling the man. Though he came with all
his pockets filled with gold and silver, they were
soon emptied. The robbers plied him with wine,
and he played wildly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When his money was all gone, he excused
himself and said he would go and get more, and
then continue the game. He went out; and, at
a sign from the leader, the two robbers who had
been sitting by the fire, rose and followed him.
They had no trouble in doing this, for the man’s
legs were already getting wobbly. One leg
wanted to go home and go to bed, and the other
wanted to go back and be stretched out under
the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, though the man’s legs were wobbly,
his head was pretty clear. He knew his way
home, and he knew his way into the stable, where
the coal-black sheep and the snow-white goat
were housed. The two robbers followed him as
closely as they dared, but it was too dark for
them to see what he was doing. They knew
that he went into the stable, and presently they
heard the jingle and clinking of gold and silver,
and then he came out with his pockets full.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They waited until he had gone on toward
the tavern and was out of sight. Then they
slipped into the yard, and crept into the stable.
It was very dark in the stable, but not too dark
to see dimly. The two men felt their way along,
and soon saw that there were but two stalls in
the stable. Each went into a stall, and began to
feel around. They expected to find bags of gold
and silver stacked around, but they were mistaken.
Finally they stooped to feel along the
ground; and, as they did so, there was a loud
thump in each stall and a yell of pain from both
robbers. When they stooped to feel along the
ground, the coal-black sheep and the snow-white
goat rushed at them, and gave each one a thump
that nearly jarred the senses out of him. The
robbers rolled over with a howl, and the goat
and the sheep thumped them again, and kept on
thumping them.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>AT LAST THE ROBBERS MANAGED TO ESCAPE</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“But at last the robbers managed to escape,
though they made a pretty looking sight. Their
hats were lost, their clothes were torn and
muddy, their heads were bleeding, their eyes
were knocked black and blue, and they felt as if
there was not a whole bone in their body. They
were too frightened to talk, but finally their
voices came to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What was it hit you?’ says one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m blessed if I know,’ says the other.
‘What hit you?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Something hard,’ says one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What did it look like?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Satan dressed in white, and he had his maul
and wedge with him. What did yours look
like?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Satan dressed in black, and he had all his
horns and hoofs with him; and I think he must
have struck me one or two licks with his forked
tail.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“They went off to the nearest branch, and
bathed themselves the best they could, but even
then they made a sorry spectacle. Their heads
and faces were still swollen, their eyes were
nearly closed, and their clothes were split and
ripped from heel to collar. They didn’t know
where to go. They knew that it wouldn’t do to
go back to the tavern and present themselves
among the guests, for that would cast suspicion
on their companions. Finally, they went outside
the village, and hid themselves under a haystack,
where they soon fell asleep, and would have slept
soundly if their dreams had not been disturbed
by visions of a black Satan and a white Satan,
both armed with long, hard horns and sharp
hoofs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All this time, the father of the children,
wobbly as he was, sat at the gaming-table with
the three robbers. The robbers were waiting for
the return of their companions, and at last they
became so uneasy that they played loosely, and the
man began to win his gold and silver back again.
At last the robbers concluded to go in search of
their companions; and the man went home, carrying
with him more gold and silver than he had
ever before brought away from the tavern. The
robbers failed to find their companions until the
next day, and the story they told was so alarming
that the band concluded to leave that part
of the country, at least for awhile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But reports and rumors of the great wealth
of the poor farmer continued to travel about, and
finally they came to the ears of a company of
merchants, who were more cunning in their line
of business than the robbers were in theirs. So
these merchants journeyed to the village, and put
up at the tavern. There they soon made the acquaintance
of the fortunate farmer who owned
the wonderful coal-black sheep and the wonderful
snow-white goat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They talked business with him from the word
go. They wanted him to put his money in all
sorts of schemes that were warranted to double it
in a few months. But the man said he didn’t
want his money doubled. He already had as
much as he wanted. He told them that if he
were to sit on the street and throw away a million
dollars a minute for ten years he’d be just as rich
at the end of that time as he was before he threw
away the first million.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, the merchants didn’t understand
this. Some said the man was crazy, but the
shrewder ones concluded that there must be some
secret behind it all. So they set to work to find
it out. They flattered him in every way. They
made him rich presents for himself, his wife, and
children. For the first time he began to wear
fine clothes and put on airs. The shrewd merchants
asked his advice about their own business,
and went about telling everybody what a wise
man he was. They pretended to tell him all their
own business secrets.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This, of course, pleased the man very much;
and, at last, one day, when he had more wine in
his head than wit, he told his merchant friends
that he made all his gold and silver by shearing a
black sheep and milking a white goat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where do you keep these wonderful creatures?’
one of the merchants asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘In my stable,’ replied the man,—’in my
stable night and day.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The greedy merchants were not long in finding
out that the man kept a coal-black sheep and
a snow-white-goat in his stable sure enough; and,
after a good deal of persuading and flattering,
they got him to consent to bring his coal-black
sheep and his snow-white goat to the tavern, so
that they might see for themselves how rare and
valuable the animals were.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, one night after his wife and children
had gone to bed, the man carried the sheep and
the goat to the tavern, and showed them to the
merchants. They offered him immense sums of
money for the animals, but he refused them all.
Then they invited him to remain to a banquet
which they had prepared. He wanted to carry
his sheep and his goat back home, and then return
to the banquet; but the merchants said the
table was already spread, and he could tie his
wonderful animals in the rear hall, where nobody
would bother them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meantime, the merchants had sent out into
the country and bought a black sheep and a white
goat; and while some of them were pouring wine
down the man’s goozle, others were untying the
wonderful black sheep and white goat, and putting
in their place the animals that had been
bought. When the time came for the man to go
home, he was so wobbly in the legs and so befuddled
in the head that he couldn’t tell the
difference between a sheep and a goat. In fact,
he had forgotten all about them, until one of the
merchants asked him if he wasn’t going to take
his rare and valuable animals back home.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The strange sheep and goat were not used
to being led about at night by a man with wobbly
legs and a befuddled head, and they cut up such
queer capers that it was much as the man could
do to keep on his feet at all. But, after so long
a time, he managed to get them home, and tied
them in the stable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far, so good: but the next morning, when
the boy and the girl got up betimes and went
out to feed their pets, as they were in the habit of
doing, they saw at once that something had happened.
Their precious pets had been made way
with, and these rough, dirty, and mean-looking
animals put in their place. One glance was
enough to satisfy the children of this, and they
set up such a wail that the whole neighborhood
was aroused. Even their father stuck his head
out of the window and asked what was the matter.
His head was still befuddled by the night’s
banquet, but his alarm sobered him instantly
when he heard what his children said. He
wouldn’t believe it at first; but when he went
out into the stable and saw for himself, he was
nearly beside himself with grief. He declared
that it was all his fault, and told what he had
done the night before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was now as poor as he ever was; and his
wife said she wasn’t sorry a bit, because he would
now have a chance to go to work and an excuse
for not hanging around the tavern. But the children
begged him to go after their coal-black
sheep and their snow-white goat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This he promised to do, and he made haste to
go to the tavern. The merchants were still there,
but they only laughed at him when he asked them
for his sheep and his goat. They called on the
tavern-keeper to witness that the man had started
home with a black sheep and a white goat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That is true,’ said the man, ‘and I have
them there now. But they are not mine. Some
of you ruffians stole mine and put these in their
place.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The merchants pretended to be very angry at
this, and made as if they would fall on the man
with their fists. But he was a stout fellow, and
was armed with a stout hickory, and so they
merely threatened. But the man failed to get his
coal-black sheep and his snow-white goat, and
went home full of grief and remorse.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c007'>XXIII.<br /> <br />THE BUTTING COW AND THE HITTING STICK.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I hope that isn’t the end of the story,”
remarked Buster John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “we can either
cut it off here, or we can carry it on for weeks
and weeks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak for yourself,” said Mrs. Meadows; “or,
if you want to, you can tell the rest of the story
yourself. No doubt you can tell it a great deal
better than I can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now you’ll have to excuse me,” remarked
Mr. Rabbit. “I thought maybe you were getting
tired, and wanted to rest. Go on with the
tale. I’m getting old and trembly in the limbs,
but I can stand it if the rest can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mrs. Meadows, turning to Buster
John and Sweetest Susan, “the children were
very much worried over the loss of the coal-black
sheep and the snow-white goat, and they made up
their minds to try and get them back. The boy
said he would go and ask Uncle Rain’s advice,
and the girl said she would visit Brother Drouth
once more. So they started on their journey, one
going east and the other going south.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They met with no adventure by the way, and,
having traveled the road once, they were not long
in coming to the end of their journey. The boy
found Uncle Rain at home, and told him all about
the loss of his beautiful black sheep. Uncle Rain
grunted at the news, and looked very solemn.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘That’s about the way I thought it would
be,’ said he. ‘It takes a mighty strong-minded
person to stand prosperity. But you needn’t be
afraid. Your sheep is not lost. The men who
have stolen him can stand great prosperity no
better than your father can. They will wrangle
among themselves, and they will never take the
sheep away from the tavern. But they shall be
punished. Come with me.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uncle Rain went out into his barnyard, and
the boy followed him. He went to a stall where
a black cow was tied. ‘This,’ said he, ‘is the
butting cow. You are to take her with you.
She will allow no one to come near her but you,
and when you give her the word she will run over
and knock down whoever and whatever is in
sight. She knows the black sheep, too, for they
have long been in the barn together. When she
begins to low, the black sheep will bleat, and in
that way you may know when you have found it.
More than that, the cow will give you the most
beautiful golden butter that ever was seen.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uncle Rain untied the cow, placed the end of
the rope in the boy’s hand, and bade him good-by.
The boy went back the way he came, the cow following
closely and seeming to be eager to go with
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The girl, who had taken the road to Brother
Drouth’s house, arrived there safely and told her
trouble. Brother Drouth said he was very sorry
about it, but as it was not a thing to weep over,
he didn’t propose to shed any tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What’s done,’ he said, ‘can’t be undone;
but I’ll see that it’s not done over again.’ He
went to a corner of the room, picked up a walking-stick,
and gave it to the little girl. ‘We have
here,’ he said, ‘a walking-stick. It is called the
hitting stick. Whenever you are in danger, or
whenever you want to punish your enemies, you
have only to say: “Hit, stick! Stick, hit!” and
neither one man nor a hundred can stand up
against it. It is not too heavy for you to carry,
but if your hands grow tired of carrying it, just
say, “Jump, stick!” and the stick will jump along
before you or by your side, just as you please.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then Brother Drouth bade the girl good-by;
and she went on her way, sometimes carrying the
hitting stick, and sometimes making it jump along
the road before her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then, while all this was going on, the
greedy merchants found themselves in a fix.
When they first got hold of the coal-black sheep
and the snow-white goat, they thought that they
had had a good deal of trouble for nothing. But
merchants, especially the merchants of those days,
when there was not as much trade as there is now,
had very sharp eyes, and it was not long before
they found the springs under the horns of the
sheep and the goat. Having found the treasure,
they remembered that the man had spent more
money in two days than the horns of the animals
would hold, and this led them to discover that the
horns were always full of treasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For a little while they were very happy, and
congratulated one another many times over. But
in the midst of their enjoyment the thought came
to them that there must be a division of this treasure.
The moment the subject was broached, the
wrangle began. There were more than a dozen
of the merchants, and the question was how to
divide the treasure so that each might have an
equal share. Though they took millions from the
horns of the black sheep and the white goat, yet
whoever had the animals would still have the most.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was a mighty serious question. They argued,
they reasoned, they disputed, and they wrangled,
and once or twice they came near having a
pitched battle. But finally, after many days, it
was decided that one party of merchants should
have the black sheep and that another party
should have the white goat. This didn’t satisfy
all of them, but it was the best that could be done;
and so they departed, the party with the white
goat going south, and the party with the black
sheep going east.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, a very curious thing happened. If
either party had kept on traveling, it would have
met the boy or the girl; one with the butting cow,
and the other with the hitting stick. But both
parties were dissatisfied; and they had gone but a
little way before they stopped, and after some talk
determined to go back. The merchants with the
white goat determined to follow on after the merchants
that had the black sheep, and secure the
animal by fair means or foul. The merchants with
the black sheep determined to follow the merchants
with the white goat, and buy the animal or
seize him. So each party turned back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The merchants with the white goat reached
the tavern first. They had hardly refreshed themselves,
when the tavern-keeper came running in, to
tell them that the other merchants were coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Then take our white goat and hide it in your
stable,’ they said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The landlord did as he was bid; and then
meeting the merchants with the black sheep, he
told them that their companions of the morning
had also returned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Then take our black sheep and hide it in
your stable,’ they said. This the landlord quickly
did, and returned to the tavern in time to hear
the merchants greet each other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What are you doing here?’ asked the black
sheep merchants.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘We have lost our white goat,’ they replied,
‘and have come here to hunt it. Why have you
returned?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘We have come on the same errand,’ said the
others. ‘We have lost our black sheep, and have
returned to find it.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, the tavern-keeper was not a very smart
man, but he had no lack of shrewdness and cunning.
He had heard the merchants wrangling
and quarreling over the black sheep and the
white goat, and now he saw them coming back
pretending to be hunting for both the animals,
though neither one was lost. He had sense enough
to see that there must be something very valuable
about the black sheep and the white goat; and so,
while the merchants were taking their refreshments,
each party eyeing the other with suspicion,
the tavern-keeper slipped out into his stable, and
carried the black sheep and the white goat to an
outhouse out of sight and hearing of the guests.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As for the merchants, they were in a pickle.
Neither party wanted to go away and leave the
other at the tavern; so they waited and waited,—the
black sheep party waiting for the white goat
party to go, and the white goat party waiting for
the black sheep party to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘When do you leave?’ says one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘As soon as we find our sheep. When do
you leave?’ says the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Quite as soon.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was not much satisfaction in this for
either side. Finally, one of the merchants called
the tavern-keeper aside, and asked him where he
had put the black sheep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘In my stable, your honor,’ replied the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then another merchant called the tavern-keeper
aside, and asked him where he had put
the white goat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘In my stable, your honor,’ he replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now as each of these merchants went out to
see that his precious animal was safe, it was perfectly
natural that they should see each other
slipping about in the yard, and that they should
meet face to face in the stable. Both made the
excuse that they thought they might find their
lost animals at that point, and both were terribly
worked up when they saw that the stable was
empty. Each went back and told his companions,
and pretty soon there was the biggest uproar
in that house that the tavern-keeper had ever
heard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Both parties went running to the stable, falling
over each other on the way; but the black
sheep and the white goat were gone. Then the
merchants went running back into the tavern, and
all began yelling at the tavern-keeper. Instead
of making any answer, that cunning chap put his
fingers in his ears, and politely asked the merchants
if they wanted to jar the roof off of the
house. They danced around him, yelling and
shaking their fists at him, but he kept his fingers
in his ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finally, they caught hold of the man, and
began to pull and haul him around at a great
rate. In this way they compelled him to take his
fingers out of his ears; but he could hear little
better, for the whole crowd was dancing around
and squalling like a lot of crazy people at a picnic.
All the tavern-keeper could hear was:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where’s our’—‘You’ve got our’—‘Sheep!’
‘Goat!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was more noise than sense to this rippit.
There was so much noise that it roused the
whole neighborhood, and the people of the village
came running in to see what the trouble was.
Among them was the mayor; and he succeeded in
quieting the rumpus, not because he was mayor,
but because he had a louder voice than any of
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When everything was quiet, the mayor asked
the merchants why they were acting like crazy
people.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Because this man has robbed us,’ they cried,
pointing to the tavern-keeper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Of what has he robbed you?’ asked the
mayor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Of a black sheep and a white goat,’ they
replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Your honor,’ said the tavern-keeper, when
the mayor had turned to him, ‘you have known
me all my life, and have never heard that I was a
thief. I want to ask these men a few questions.’
By this time the two parties of merchants had
ranged themselves on different sides of the room.
The tavern-keeper turned to the black sheep
party. ‘Didn’t the men over there come into
this house and tell you that they had lost their
white goat?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘They certainly did,’ was the reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he turned to the white goat party.
‘Didn’t the men over there tell you that they
had lost their black sheep and had come back to
hunt it?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘They certainly did,’ came the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Both parties tried to explain that they had
placed their animals in charge of the tavern-keeper,
but while they were hemming and hawing
a queer thing happened. The boy had come up
with his butting cow; and seeing the merchants
still in the tavern, he led her to the door, and told
her to do her whole duty, and nothing but her
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“While the merchants were trying to explain,
the cow rushed into the room with a bellow, her
tail curled over her back, and went at the men
with head down and horn points up. Tables and
chairs were nothing to the butting cow. She
ran over them and through them; and in a little
while the room was cleared of the merchants, and
some of them were hurt so badly that they could
scarcely crawl away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The mayor had jumped through a window, and
the village people had scattered in all directions.
By this time the tavern-keeper, who had remained
unhurt, was laughing to himself at the fix the
merchants found themselves in, for the butting
cow was still pursuing them. But he laughed too
soon. The little girl came to the door with her
hitting stick.</p>
<div id='i292'  class='figcenter id025'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“HIT STICK! STICK HIT!” SHE CRIED</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“‘Hit, stick! Stick, hit!’ she cried; and in
an instant the stick was mauling the tavern-keeper
over the head and shoulders and all about
the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Help! help!’ shouted the tavern-keeper.
‘Somebody run here! Help! I’ll tell you where
they are! I’ll show you where they are!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Stop, stick!’ said the girl. ‘Now show me
where my snow-white goat is.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes!’ exclaimed the boy. ‘Show me where
my coal-black sheep is!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Come,’ said the tavern-keeper; and he went
as fast as he could to the outhouse where he had
hid the animals. They were in there, safe and
sound, and the children made haste to carry them
home.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the farmer was once more rich and prosperous.
He shunned the tavern and kept at work,
and in this way prosperity brought happiness and
content to all the family. And by giving freely
to the poor they made others happy too.”</p>

an empty stomach has a way of talking so it can
be heard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is true,” replied Mr. Rabbit; “but there
is a living in the world for every creature, if he
will only get out of bed and walk about and look
for it. But a good many folks and a heap of the
animals think that if there is a living in the world
for everybody, it ought to be handed round in a
silver dish. Then there are some folks and a
great many creatures that are not satisfied with
what they are, but want to be somebody or something
else. That sort of talk puts me in mind of
the Diddypawn.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the Diddypawn?” asked Buster
John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it would be hard to tell you at this
time of day,” replied Mr. Rabbit, rubbing his chin
thoughtfully. “There are no Diddypawns now,
and I don’t know that I ever saw but one. He
is the chap I’m going to tell you about. He was
a great big strong creature, with a long head and
short ears, and eyes that could see in the dark.
He had legs that could carry him many a mile in
a day, and teeth strong enough to crunch an
elephant’s hind leg. The Diddypawn would have
weeded a wide row if he had been a mind to; but,
instead of doing that, he just lay in the mud on
the river bank, and let the sun shine and the rain
fall. He had but to reach down in the water to
pick up a fish, or up in the bushes to catch a
bird.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But all this didn’t make his mind easy. He
wasn’t contented. The thought came to him
that a fine large creature such as he was ought
to be able to swim as fast as a fish, and fly as
high as a bird. So he worried and worried
and worried about it, until there was no peace
in that neighborhood. All the creatures that
crawled, or walked, or swam, or flew, heard of
the Diddypawn’s troubles. At first they paid
no attention to him, but he groaned so long
and he groaned so loud that they couldn’t
help but pay attention. They couldn’t sleep at
night, and they couldn’t have any peace in the
daytime.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For I don’t know how long the Diddypawn
rolled and tumbled in the mud, and moaned and
groaned because he didn’t have as many fins as
the fishes and as many feathers as the birds. He
moaned and mumbled in the daytime, and
groaned and grumbled at night. The other creatures
paid no attention to him at first; but matters
went from bad to worse, and they soon found
that they had to do something or leave the
country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, after awhile the fishes held a convention,
and the porpoise and the catfish made speeches,
saying that the Diddypawn was in a peck of
trouble, and asking what could be done for him.
Finally, after a good deal of talk about one thing
and another, the convention of fishes concluded
to call on the Diddypawn in a body, and ask him
what in the name of goodness he wanted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This they did; and the reply that the Diddypawn
made was that he wanted to know how to
swim as well as any fish. There wasn’t anything
unreasonable in this; and so the convention, after
a good deal more talk, said that the best way to
do would be for every fish to lend the Diddypawn
a fin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The convention told the Diddypawn about
this, and it made him grin from one ear to the
other to think that he would be able to swim as
fast as the fishes. He rolled from the bank into
the shallow water, and the fishes, as good as their
word, loaned him each a fin. With these the
Diddypawn found he was able to get about in the
water right nimbly. He swam around and around,
far and near, and finally reached an island where
there were some trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t go too near the land,’ says the catfish.
‘Don’t go too near the land,’ says the perch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Don’t bother about me,’ says the Diddypawn.
“I can walk on the land as well as I can
swim in the water.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘But our fins!’ says the catfish and the
perch. ‘If you go on land and let them dry in
the sun, they’ll be no good to either us or you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No matter,’ says the Diddypawn, ‘on the
land I’ll go, and I’ll be bound the fins will be
just as limber after they get dry as they were
when they were wet.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the fishes set up such a cry and made
such a fuss that the Diddypawn concluded to give
them back their fins, while he went on dry land
and rested himself. He went on the island, and
stretched himself out in the tall grass at the foot
of the big trees, and soon fell asleep. When he
awoke, the sun was nearly down. He crawled
to the waterside, and soon saw that the fishes had
all gone away. He had no way of calling them
up or of sending them a message, and so there he
was.</p>
<div id='i298'  class='figcenter id026'>
<img src='images/i298.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>IT MADE HIM GRIN FROM EAR TO EAR</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“While the Diddypawn was lying there wondering
how he was going to get back home, he
heard a roaring and rustling noise in the air.
Looking up, he saw that the sky was nearly black
with birds. They came in swarms, in droves, and
in flocks. There were big birds and little birds,
and all sorts and sizes of birds. The trees on the
island were their roosting-place, but they were
coming home earlier than usual, because they
wanted to get rid of the moanings and groanings
of the Diddypawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The birds came and settled in the trees, and
were about to say good-night to one another, when
the Diddypawn rolled over, and began to moan
and groan and growl and grumble. At once the
birds ceased their chattering, and began to listen.
Then they knew they would have no sound sleep
that night if something wasn’t done; and so the
King-Bird flew down, lit close to the Diddypawn’s
ear, and asked him what in the name of goodness
gracious he was doing there, how he got there,
and what the trouble was anyway.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All the answer the Diddypawn made was to
roll over on his other side, and moan and mumble.
Once more the King-Bird fluttered in the
air, and lit near the Diddypawn’s ear, and asked
him what in the name of goodness gracious he
was doing there, how he got there, and what the
trouble was anyway. For answer, the Diddypawn
turned on the other side, and groaned and grumbled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long this was kept up I’ll never tell you,
but after a while, the Diddypawn said the trouble
with him was that he wanted to fly. He said he
would fly well enough if he only had feathers;
but, as it was, he didn’t have a feather to his
name, or to his hide either.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the birds held a convention over this
situation, and after a good deal of loud talk, it
was decided that each bird should lend the Diddypawn
a feather. This was done in the midst of a
good deal of fluttering and chattering. When
the Diddypawn was decked out in his feathers, he
strutted around and shook his wings at a great
rate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Where shall I fly to?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, there was another island not far away,
on which everything was dead,—the trees, the
bushes, the grass, and even the honeysuckle vines.
But some of the trees were still standing. With
their lack of leaf and twig they looked like a
group of tall, black lighthouses. When the Diddypawn
asked where he should fly, Brother Turkey
Buzzard made this remark:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘If you want to fly fast and not fly far,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Fly to the place where the dead trees are!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“To this the Diddypawn made reply,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I want to fly fast and not too far,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So I’ll fly to the place where the dead trees are!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“Then the Diddypawn fluttered his feathers
and hopped about, and, after a while, took a running
start and began to fly. He didn’t fly very
well at first, being a new hand at the business.
He wobbled from side to side, and sometimes it
seemed that he was going to fall in the water, but
he always caught himself just in time. After a
while he reached the island where everything was
dead, and landed with a tremendous splash and
splutter in the wet marsh grass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As dark had not set in, the most of the birds
flew along with the Diddypawn, to see how he
was going to come out. The Diddypawn had
hardly lit, before Brother Turkey Buzzard ups
and says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I don’t want my feather to get wet, and so
I’ll just take it back again.’ This was the sign
for all the birds. None wanted his feather to get
wet, so they just swooped down on the Diddypawn
and took their feathers one by one. When the
fluttering was over, the Diddypawn had no more
feathers than fins. But he made no complaint.
He had it in his mind that he’d rest easy during
the night and begin his complaints the next morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Says he, ‘I’ve got the birds and the fishes so
trained that when I want to fly, all I’ve got to do
is to turn over on my left side and grunt, and
when I want to swim, all I’ve got to do is to turn
over on my right side and groan.’ Then the
Diddypawn smiled, until there were wrinkles in
his countenance as deep and as wide as a horse-trough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the birds went back to their roosting-place
that night, and there was nothing to disturb
them; and the fishes swam around the next day,
and there was nothing to bother them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Matters went on in this way for several days,
and at last some of the birds began to ask about
the Diddypawn. ‘Had anybody seen him?’
or ‘Did anybody know how he was getting
on?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“This was passed around among the birds,
until at last it came to the ears of Brother Turkey
Buzzard. He stretched out his wings and
gaped, and said that he had been thinking about
taking his family and calling on the Diddypawn.
So that very day, Brother Turkey Buzzard, his
wife and his children and some of his blood kin,
went down to the dead island, to call on the
Diddypawn. They went and stayed several days.
The rest of the birds, when they came home to
roost, could see the Turkey Buzzard family sitting
in the dead trees; and after so long a time
they came back, and went to roost with the rest
of the birds. Some of them asked how the Diddypawn
was getting on, and Brother Turkey
Buzzard made this reply:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The Diddypawn needs neither feather nor fin,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He’s been falling off, till he’s grown quite thin,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He has lost all his meat and all of his skin,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And he needs now a bag to put his bones in.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“This made Brother Owl hoot a little, but it
wasn’t long before all the birds were fast asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Rabbit never knew how the children liked
the story of the Diddypawn. Buster John was
about to say something, but he saw little Mr.
Thimblefinger pull out his watch and look up at
the bottom of the spring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What time is it?” asked Mrs. Meadows, seeing
that Mr. Thimblefinger still held his watch in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A quarter to twelve.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” cried Sweetest Susan, “we promised
mamma to be back by dinner time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s plenty of time for that,” said Mrs.
Meadows. “I do hope you’ll come again. It
rests me to see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The children shook hands all around when Mr.
Thimblefinger said he was ready to go, and Mr.
Rabbit remarked to Buster John:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t forget what I told you about Aaron.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no danger of that, Buster John said;
and then the children followed Mr. Thimblefinger,
who led them safely through the spring, and they
were soon at home again.</p>
